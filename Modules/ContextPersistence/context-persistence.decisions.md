### Decision: separate intent, state, and reasoning into three files
Timestamp: 2026-04-07T12:00:00-04:00

**Context**
- Chat history is ephemeral and does not reliably preserve feature intent across sessions.

**Decision**
- Use three canonical feature files: spec, state, and decision ledger.

**Reasoning**
- This keeps intent, current reality, and historical reasoning distinct and easier to validate.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep everything in one file.
- Use only execution specs.
- Rely on chat history and code only.

**Impact**
- The system is more structured and easier to resume, but requires disciplined updates.

### Decision: introduce CLI surface for context initialization and validation
Timestamp: 2026-04-07T12:30:00-04:00

**Context**
- Context artifacts exist but must currently be created and validated manually.
- This limits usability and prevents consistent enforcement.

**Decision**
- Introduce CLI commands to initialize and validate feature context:
  - context init
  - context doctor

**Reasoning**
- A CLI surface makes the system usable for both humans and LLMs.
- Deterministic outputs allow future automation and enforcement layers.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep context creation manual.
- Delay CLI until later phases.
- Use non-deterministic or conversational tooling.

**Impact**
- Enables consistent creation and validation of feature context.
- Forms the foundation for later enforcement and execution phases.

**Spec Reference**
- Goals
- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: add deterministic spec-state alignment checking
Timestamp: 2026-04-07T13:30:00-04:00

**Context**
- Structural validation alone cannot detect drift between intended behavior and recorded feature state.
- The context system needs a deterministic semantic layer before inspect, verify, and enforcement can be trusted.

**Decision**
- Add a conservative alignment engine and CLI command:
  - context check-alignment

**Reasoning**
- Alignment checking is necessary to detect untracked requirements, unsupported state claims, and unexplained divergence.
- Deterministic heuristics are easier to test, explain, and trust than aggressive semantic inference.
- Decision-backed divergence must be handled differently from unexplained divergence.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Rely on manual review only.
- Delay alignment until later phases.
- Use LLM-based semantic matching immediately.

**Impact**
- Foundry can now detect meaningful mismatches between spec and state.
- The context system now has a semantic validation layer in addition to structural validation.
- This enables later inspect, verify, and refusal-to-proceed phases.

**Spec Reference**
- Goals
- Constraints
- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: compose doctor and alignment into inspect and verify workflows
Timestamp: 2026-04-07T14:00:00-04:00

**Context**
- Structural validation and semantic alignment existed separately, but there was no unified inspection or verification surface.
- Later enforcement phases need a deterministic proceed/fail signal rather than ad hoc interpretation of multiple commands.

**Decision**
- Add:
  - inspect context
  - verify context
- Reuse doctor and alignment services rather than reimplementing either path.

**Reasoning**
- A single inspection surface improves visibility.
- A deterministic verification surface provides a clean machine-readable gate for future enforcement.
- Reuse preserves consistency and reduces duplicate logic.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep doctor and alignment as separate manual checks only.
- Reimplement validation and alignment inside inspect and verify.
- Delay verify semantics until later phases.

**Impact**
- Foundry now has a unified context inspection workflow.
- Foundry now has deterministic pass/fail semantics for feature context.
- This creates the clean proceed/fail boundary needed for 35D5.

**Spec Reference**
- Goals
- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: promote context workflow guidance into framework and scaffold onboarding
Timestamp: 2026-04-07T14:30:00-04:00

**Context**
- Context commands were implemented, but framework and scaffold guidance still described the workflow as not yet available.
- This created drift between the documented onboarding path and the actual CLI behavior.

**Decision**
- Update framework and scaffold onboarding guidance to describe the implemented context workflow.
- Use verify context as the primary machine-readable proceed/fail gate.

**Reasoning**
- Onboarding docs must reflect real command behavior once the contract exists.
- A single documented gate reduces ambiguity for both humans and automation.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Leave bootstrap-only wording in place.
- Document different proceed/fail gates across framework and app scaffolds.
- Delay onboarding updates until later phases.

**Impact**
- Framework and scaffold guidance now match the implemented context system.
- New apps inherit the same deterministic context workflow expectations as the framework repo.

**Spec Reference**
- Goals
- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: expose explicit readiness signals for context enforcement
Timestamp: 2026-04-07T15:00:00-04:00

**Context**
- Doctor, alignment, inspect, and verify each reported context health, but later execution phases need a single explicit readiness interpretation.
- The workflow needed a deterministic answer to whether meaningful implementation may proceed.

**Decision**
- Expose can_proceed and requires_repair consistently across context doctor, context check-alignment, inspect context, and verify context.
- Keep refusal-to-proceed semantics aligned across CLI output and onboarding guidance.

**Reasoning**
- A shared readiness model keeps inspection, verification, and later enforcement layers consistent.
- Explicit readiness signals reduce hidden interpretation by users and tooling.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Infer readiness separately in each command.
- Keep pass/fail semantics only in verify context.
- Delay readiness hardening until feature execution exists.

**Impact**
- Later execution commands can reuse the existing context readiness contract without inventing a second policy path.
- Users and automation now receive the same deterministic readiness signals from every context surface.

**Spec Reference**
- Constraints
- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: expose exact implementation-log entry content through a deterministic CLI surface
Timestamp: 2026-04-17T13:05:00-04:00

**Context**
- Exact implementation-log coverage is now enforced for active execution specs, which made correct log-entry formatting part of the repository gate rather than a soft convention.
- The canonical format already existed, but agents and humans still had to reconstruct the exact content manually before appending an entry.
- The system needed a direct, deterministic way to surface that content without widening into automatic historical repair or draft logging.

**Decision**
- Add a deterministic CLI-owned surface that emits the exact canonical implementation-log entry content for one active execution spec.
- Keep draft execution specs out of scope and fail clearly when a target is draft-only, malformed, or unknown.
- Reuse canonical execution-spec identity and the existing implementation-log formatter so suggestion output matches validation exactly.

**Reasoning**
- Exact deterministic output reduces avoidable logging mistakes while preserving the existing append-only log format.
- Reusing the same underlying identity and formatting rules keeps enforcement and suggestion aligned.
- Keeping the scope to active specs preserves lifecycle boundaries and avoids inventing chronology for draft planning artifacts.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Leave log-entry construction manual after adding validation enforcement.
- Add suggestion text only inside validation failures.
- Auto-append or auto-backfill missing entries in the same step.

**Impact**
- Humans and agents can now request canonical log-entry content directly instead of reconstructing it from documentation.
- Implementation-log suggestion and validation now share one exact formatting contract.
- Draft specs remain exempt from implementation chronology until they are promoted and completed.

**Spec Reference**
- Constraints
- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: require implementation-log coverage for active execution specs during verification
Timestamp: 2026-04-17T12:20:00-04:00

**Context**
- Active execution specs already represented promoted bounded work, and successful new implementations now auto-appended implementation-log entries.
- Older active specs could still remain unlogged, which left implementation history incomplete even though `docs/features/implementation-log.md` was already canonical.
- The feature needed an enforced deterministic rule for that history without pulling drafts into the same requirement.

**Decision**
- Require exact implementation-log coverage for active execution specs through the existing deterministic execution-spec validation surface.
- Keep draft execution specs exempt from implementation-log coverage.
- Treat missing coverage as a stable verification failure rather than a documentation-only convention.

**Reasoning**
- Active-versus-draft placement is the current explicit repository signal available to distinguish completed bounded work from planning artifacts.
- Exact matching keeps the rule deterministic and easy for both humans and automation to repair.
- Reusing an existing verification surface is narrower and safer than adding a second historical-audit workflow.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Leave implementation-log coverage as a manual convention.
- Require log entries for drafts as well.
- Add fuzzy historical inference or LLM-based matching.

**Impact**
- Missing implementation-log coverage for active specs is now machine-detectable.
- Draft specs remain outside implementation chronology until they are promoted and actually completed.
- Repository verification can now expose incomplete execution history explicitly instead of silently tolerating it.

**Spec Reference**
- Constraints
- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: keep planner output draft-only and verify one write per invocation
Timestamp: 2026-04-16T10:05:00-04:00

**Context**
- `plan feature` produced bounded execution specs deterministically, but it still wrote them directly into the active spec directory.
- The planner also trusted its intended output path without verifying that one invocation created exactly one visible execution spec file at the reported location.
- That blurred the draft-versus-active lifecycle and made the planner result contract weaker than the filesystem truth it was reporting.

**Decision**
- Write planner-generated execution specs only under `docs/features/<feature>/specs/drafts/`.
- After writing, verify that the exact reported draft path exists and that no additional execution spec files were created by the invocation before returning `planned`.

**Reasoning**
- Planned specs are proposals and should remain non-executable until a deliberate promotion step moves them out of `drafts`.
- Post-write verification keeps `spec_id`, `spec_path`, and `actions_taken` aligned with the actual filesystem side effects.
- Verifying one visible write is a safer surgical fix than redesigning the planner pipeline or adding broader transactional machinery.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep writing planner output directly into the active execution-spec directory.
- Rely on the current single `file_put_contents()` call without post-write verification.
- Auto-promote planner output immediately so `implement spec` can consume it directly.

**Impact**
- `plan feature` now follows a clearer lifecycle: plan, review in drafts, promote, then implement.
- Planner success output is now tied to verified filesystem reality instead of intended write targets alone.
- Freshly planned specs are no longer immediately executable until they are promoted to active status.

**Spec Reference**
- Constraints
- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: accept exact feature-plus-id shorthand for implement spec
Timestamp: 2026-04-16T09:45:01-04:00

**Context**
- `implement spec` already resolved active execution specs deterministically, but the CLI still required either the full `<feature>/<id>-<slug>` ref or a globally unique filename shorthand.
- Developers and agents often already know the target feature and canonical numeric id before they need the slug text.
- Convenience could not weaken active-versus-draft rules or deterministic failure behavior.

**Decision**
- Accept `implement spec <feature> <id>` as a second deterministic invocation form.
- Resolve the id only within the provided feature, require an exact canonical hierarchical-id match, and fail clearly for malformed, unknown, draft-only, or ambiguous targets.

**Reasoning**
- Feature-plus-id shorthand removes unnecessary slug typing without guessing.
- Restricting resolution to one feature preserves determinism and avoids cross-feature ambiguity.
- Explicit malformed-id and draft-only failures keep canonical execution-spec lifecycle rules intact.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep only full feature-qualified refs and unique filename shorthand.
- Add fuzzy slug lookup or partial-id guessing.
- Auto-promote draft specs when no active match exists.

**Impact**
- `implement spec` is faster to invoke when the feature and canonical id are already known.
- Existing full-ref and unique filename shorthand behavior remains available.
- Active-only resolution and deterministic blocked results remain unchanged in principle.

**Spec Reference**
- Constraints
- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: make canonical conflict detection prohibition-aware
Timestamp: 2026-04-15T16:05:00-04:00

**Context**
- Canonical conflict detection already blocked obvious execution-spec contradictions, but it still relied too heavily on shared topic words when prohibition language was involved.
- Equivalent negative formulations such as `Do not append log entries for draft specs.` and `must not log draft specs` could still look contradictory if the detector ignored polarity and narrowed clauses down to overlapping nouns.

**Decision**
- Compare canonical and execution-spec instruction clauses with explicit polarity awareness.
- Treat aligned prohibitions as non-conflicting, require opposing polarity before blocking, and preserve nested negative lead-in context in parsed execution-spec instruction items.

**Reasoning**
- Shared nouns such as `log`, `entries`, or `draft specs` are not enough to prove a contradiction without polarity and target alignment.
- Preserving full negative clause context keeps conflict checks deterministic while avoiding false positives from orphaned bullet fragments.
- Tightening the matcher is safer than weakening the blocked-result contract around real canonical conflicts.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep relying on shared lexical overlap plus stripped forbidden clauses.
- Add broader semantic or LLM-based contradiction detection.
- Suppress conflict checks for all negative execution-spec instructions.

**Impact**
- Equivalent prohibitions are no longer blocked as canonical conflicts.
- True contradictions with opposing polarity and substantially similar target actions still fail deterministically.
- Execution-spec workflows are less noisy and more trustworthy when canonical rules use prohibition language.

**Spec Reference**
- Constraints
- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: expand doctor diagnostics with two high-signal semantic rules
Timestamp: 2026-04-20T13:37:14-04:00

**Context**
- The normalized doctor-rule model existed, but it still only enforced execution-spec drift beyond structural validation.
- Foundry needed stronger feature-scoped context diagnostics without redesigning doctor or verify-context outputs.
- The new rules needed to stay high-signal and avoid broad speculative semantic duplication.

**Decision**
- Add exactly two new doctor diagnostic rules:
  - `STALE_COMPLETED_ITEMS_IN_NEXT_STEPS`
  - `DECISION_MISSING_FOR_STATE_DIVERGENCE`
- Keep both rules inside the normalized doctor-rule model and reuse the existing doctor and verify-context output contracts unchanged.

**Reasoning**
- Stale completed work in `Next Steps` is a common high-signal maintenance failure that the structural validators and alignment checker did not already surface directly.
- Missing decision coverage for real current-state divergence is a high-value continuity issue because it breaks resumability even when the divergence is intentional.
- Reusing the existing alignment heuristics for the divergence rule keeps the semantic threshold conservative and deterministic.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Add `STATE_CLAIM_WITHOUT_SPEC_SUPPORT` as the second rule.
- Add `SPEC_REQUIREMENT_NOT_TRACKED_IN_STATE` as the second rule.
- Expand the doctor or verify output schemas to expose a second diagnostic channel.

**Impact**
- `context doctor` now catches two additional high-signal semantic context problems without changing its public JSON shape.
- `verify context` now surfaces those doctor issues through its existing flattened issue list.
- The canonical context workflow is stricter about stale planning state and undocumented intentional divergence.

**Spec Reference**
- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: add an explicit conservative context repair surface
Timestamp: 2026-04-21T13:20:00-04:00

**Context**
- Foundry already had deterministic doctor, inspect, verify, and normalization infrastructure for canonical feature context.
- Low-risk canonical spec/state cleanup still required repetitive manual edits even when the safe transformation was already structurally obvious.
- Any new repair surface had to stay explicit and conservative so it would not invent semantic content or rewrite decision history.

**Decision**
- Add `context repair --feature=<feature> --json` as an explicit CLI-owned repair surface.
- Limit automatic repairs to safe normalization-style changes on canonical feature spec and state documents.
- Reuse the existing inspect and verify pipeline to compute post-repair consumability, fail clearly when critical canonical inputs are missing, and leave ambiguous semantic divergence for manual action.

**Reasoning**
- An explicit repair command keeps file modification deliberate and preserves existing doctor and verify behavior when repair mode is not invoked.
- Reusing the existing analysis pipeline keeps repair results aligned with the same doctor, alignment, and consumability contracts already used elsewhere.
- Restricting scope to meaning-preserving normalization preserves trust and avoids silent invention of decisions or intent.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Run repair implicitly during ordinary verification.
- Expand repair mode to rewrite decision ledgers or resolve semantic divergence automatically.
- Leave all low-risk canonical context cleanup manual.

**Impact**
- Low-risk canonical spec/state cleanup is now faster and more consistent.
- Ambiguous semantic repair still requires human judgment.
- Context verification and execution continue to fail closed outside explicit repair mode.

**Spec Reference**
- Constraints
- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: coalesce overlapping doctor diagnostics conservatively after rule evaluation
Timestamp: 2026-04-21T13:33:30-04:00

**Context**
- The normalized doctor-rule infrastructure made it easier to add more feature-scoped diagnostics, but overlapping rules could now describe the same underlying problem more than once.
- Repeated issue rows and repeated repair guidance would make `context doctor` and `verify context` noisier as the rule set grows, even when the underlying remediation had not changed.
- The output still needed to stay deterministic, machine-readable, and conservative enough not to hide genuinely distinct problems.

**Decision**
- Add a deterministic post-processing pass after rule evaluation that coalesces overlapping rule results when they share the same repair target, canonical message, and required-action set.
- Deduplicate exact duplicate issue rows and duplicate required actions before doctor and verify outputs are returned.
- Keep distinct problems separate when their remediation path, message, or target semantics differ.

**Reasoning**
- Post-processing the normalized rule results is narrower and safer than redesigning the rule engine itself.
- Coalescing on explicit fields preserves determinism and avoids fuzzy semantic clustering.
- Preserving only one canonical overlapping issue keeps outputs smaller without weakening the existing doctor and verify JSON contracts.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Leave duplicate issues and repeated actions in place.
- Add fuzzy semantic similarity or LLM-based clustering.
- Redesign individual rules to coordinate with each other directly.

**Impact**
- `context doctor` and `verify context` now stay more readable as more diagnostics are added.
- Duplicate remediation guidance is reduced without hiding genuinely different failures.
- External output contracts remain stable while issue counts become less noisy.

**Spec Reference**
- Constraints
- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: extend reusable context normalization to canonical feature specs only
Timestamp: 2026-04-21T10:06:09-04:00

**Context**
- Reusable deterministic normalization already existed for framework-owned state-document writes.
- Canonical feature spec documents were still vulnerable to ordering, spacing, and duplicate-bullet drift on framework-owned write paths such as initialization and safe repairs.
- Decision ledgers remained explicitly out of scope because they are append-only historical records rather than current-intent artifacts.

**Decision**
- Extend reusable context normalization to `docs/features/<feature>/<feature>.spec.md`.
- Keep the expansion limited to canonical feature specs and do not normalize decision ledgers in this step.
- Apply the new normalization only through narrow framework-owned spec write paths rather than broad repository-wide rewrites.

**Reasoning**
- Feature specs are current-intent artifacts, so conservative deterministic normalization is safer there than in historical ledgers.
- Reusing the existing normalization infrastructure reduces drift without inventing a second disconnected formatting path.
- Limiting integration to framework-owned writes makes the behavior real and reusable while avoiding speculative mass rewrites.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Leave feature specs unnormalized outside state documents.
- Normalize decision ledgers in the same step.
- Add a broad repository markdown formatter.

**Impact**
- Canonical feature specs now become more stable and easier to diff when Foundry writes or repairs them.
- Existing state normalization remains intact while spec normalization gains the same deterministic write discipline.
- Decision-ledger history remains untouched until a future dedicated step addresses it.

**Spec Reference**

- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: fail closed on generic planner fallback output
Timestamp: 2026-04-15T15:10:00-04:00

**Context**
- `plan feature` already blocked abstract planning gaps, but weak candidates could still collapse into low-information fallback slugs such as `initial`.
- Planner-generated completion signals also still included broad project-health checks that did not verify the bounded step itself.

**Decision**
- Fail closed when planner output collapses into a generic fallback slug or other low-information execution-spec content.
- Accept planner candidates only when slug, purpose, scope, requested changes, and completion signals all remain concrete and bounded to the step itself.

**Reasoning**
- A blocked planning result is safer than writing an execution spec that looks valid but carries almost no actionable information.
- Slugs and completion signals should reflect the bounded work order itself so generated specs stay trustworthy as the next execution input.
- Quality-gating planner output keeps determinism intact without introducing speculative or model-driven refinement.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep allowing fallback slugs such as `initial` when no better slug can be derived.
- Accept broad project-health completion signals as sufficient planner output.
- Solve weak plans by rewriting canonical context automatically.

**Impact**
- `plan feature` now blocks low-information fallback specs instead of writing misleading files.
- Generated execution specs now use completion signals that verify the bounded step itself rather than broad repository health.
- Concrete bounded plans still generate deterministically when canonical context contains a meaningful next step.

**Spec Reference**
- Constraints
- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: generalize feature state normalization into a reusable path
Timestamp: 2026-04-15T13:31:49-04:00

**Context**
- The `context-persistence` state document had already been cleaned up manually, but the framework still lacked a reusable way to normalize other feature state documents.
- Without a shared normalization path, future state updates could reintroduce ordering noise, duplicate bullets, and stale completed leftovers that were unrelated to real feature drift.

**Decision**
- Introduce a reusable deterministic state-document normalizer for feature state files.
- Normalize `Current State`, `Open Questions`, and `Next Steps` into canonical section order when present.
- Integrate the normalizer into the framework-owned state write path used by context execution updates.

**Reasoning**
- A dedicated normalizer keeps state cleanup explicit and reusable without turning the framework into a broad markdown formatter.
- Canonical state ordering and conservative stale-item cleanup reduce noisy diffs while preserving current meaning.
- Integrating at the existing state write path makes the behavior real immediately and keeps future reuse cheap.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep state normalization as one-off manual cleanup only.
- Add a repository-wide markdown formatter for context files.
- Normalize feature specs and decision ledgers in the same pass.

**Impact**
- Framework-owned state updates now persist normalized feature state documents deterministically.
- Duplicate bullets and obvious stale completed leftovers are removed more consistently.
- Later drift-detection and planning work can rely on cleaner canonical state inputs.

**Spec Reference**

### Decision: normalize internal context-doctor rule evaluation
Timestamp: 2026-04-15T10:12:54-04:00

**Context**
- `EXECUTION_SPEC_DRIFT` had been added successfully, but its logic lived directly inside `ContextDoctorService`.
- Future feature-scoped doctor diagnostics would become harder to add consistently if rule evaluation, file-bucket attachment, required-action contribution, and verify flattening stayed ad hoc.

**Decision**
- Introduce a normalized internal rule model for feature-scoped context-doctor diagnostics.
- Represent doctor rules through stable normalized results that carry code, message, targets, repair semantics, and required actions.
- Use that rule model to drive `EXECUTION_SPEC_DRIFT`, doctor file-bucket rendering, and centralized doctor-to-verify issue flattening.

**Reasoning**
- A normalized rule model makes future doctor checks cheaper to add without changing external command contracts.
- Centralized mapping keeps doctor and verify deterministic and avoids rule-specific branching in verify-context.
- Keeping the external JSON unchanged preserves compatibility for users and automation while improving the internal structure.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep adding rule-specific conditionals inside `ContextDoctorService` and `ContextInspectionService`.
- Expose a new public diagnostics schema just for doctor rules.
- Delay internal cleanup until several more doctor rules existed.

**Impact**
- `context doctor` and `verify context` keep their current external output shapes.
- `EXECUTION_SPEC_DRIFT` now serves as the reference implementation for future doctor rules.
- Future feature-scoped diagnostics can be added with less duplication and lower regression risk.

**Spec Reference**
- Constraints
- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: diagnose execution-spec drift through existing doctor and verify pipelines
Timestamp: 2026-04-15T09:57:48-04:00

**Context**
- Execution specs can now accumulate under `docs/features/<feature>/specs/` and `docs/features/<feature>/specs/drafts/`, but canonical feature context files may still be missing for a target feature.
- Without an explicit diagnostic, agents and developers could mistake execution specs for authoritative context when running doctor or verify workflows.

**Decision**
- Detect execution-spec drift in `context doctor` whenever execution specs exist for a feature and one or more canonical feature context files are missing.
- Attach `EXECUTION_SPEC_DRIFT` to the missing canonical file buckets and reuse existing required-actions guidance.
- Surface the same doctor issue through `verify context` without changing the flattened verification contract.

**Reasoning**
- Canonical feature context must remain the only authoritative source of intent and state.
- Reusing existing doctor and verify issue shapes keeps diagnostics deterministic and machine-readable for automation.
- Repair guidance should steer users toward initializing canonical context rather than treating execution specs as substitutes.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Add a new top-level doctor diagnostics collection just for execution-spec drift.
- Ignore execution-spec presence until later execution-spec validation phases.
- Infer missing canonical context from execution specs automatically.

**Impact**
- Doctor and verify now fail closed when execution specs exist without complete canonical feature context.
- Missing canonical files are surfaced alongside explicit warnings not to rely on execution specs as source of truth.
- Feature discovery for all-feature doctor and verify runs now includes execution-spec directories when they contain planning artifacts.

**Spec Reference**
- Constraints
- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: adopt hierarchical padded execution-spec filenames and filename-only headings
Timestamp: 2026-04-14T10:05:00-04:00

**Context**
- Foundry’s execution-spec workflows were using a mix of feature-prefixed headings and single-segment filename assumptions even though spec placement and naming were already evolving into a broader contract.
- The system needed a canonical rule that keeps ordering deterministic and removes identity duplication from the spec body.

**Decision**
- Use `docs/features/<feature>/specs/<id>-<slug>.md` as the canonical execution-spec path, with `<id>` composed of one or more dot-separated 3-digit segments.
- Make execution-spec headings mirror the filename only as `# Execution Spec: <id>-<slug>`.
- Keep root-id planning draft-aware so existing active or draft ids are not reused accidentally.

**Reasoning**
- Padded segments preserve logical ordering under ordinary lexical sort.
- Filename-only headings align the visible document identity with the actual canonical identity.
- Scanning both active and draft ids preserves immutability and avoids accidental collisions during planning.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep single-segment `NNN-name` assumptions in the planner and resolver.
- Preserve feature-prefixed headings.
- Ignore draft ids when allocating the next planned execution spec.

**Impact**
- `implement spec`, `plan feature`, templates, docs, and tests now share one execution-spec naming contract.
- Execution specs remain secondary work orders, but their identity and hierarchy are now clearer and more deterministic.

### Decision: execute feature work from canonical context with bounded repair
Timestamp: 2026-04-07T15:30:00-04:00

**Context**
- Foundry could inspect and verify feature context, but it still lacked a public execution path that consumed canonical context artifacts directly.
- Later execution needed to remain fail-closed, deterministic, and repair-first.

**Decision**
- Add implement feature as a strict extension of the context system.
- Reuse context validation and readiness signals as the execution gate.
- Allow only bounded, deterministic repair operations before execution when repair is explicitly requested.

**Reasoning**
- Canonical context must remain authoritative once feature execution begins.
- Reusing doctor, alignment, inspect, and verify preserves consistency and avoids a second execution policy path.
- Bounded repair keeps execution deterministic while still unblocking simple context issues.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Execute from ad hoc prompts only.
- Bypass context enforcement during implementation.
- Allow speculative context rewriting during auto-repair.

**Impact**
- Foundry can now execute feature work from canonical context artifacts.
- Feature execution updates state and decisions, then revalidates context before finishing.
- CI and scripted workflows can consume deterministic blocked, repaired, and completed results from the same context contract.

**Spec Reference**

### Decision: add spec-driven execution as a secondary entry point
Timestamp: 2026-04-10T12:00:00-04:00

**Context**
- Foundry could already execute feature work from canonical context artifacts, but it did not yet have a workflow-oriented entry point for bounded execution specs.
- Execution specs needed to remain secondary work orders rather than becoming a second source of feature truth.

**Decision**
- Add implement spec as a secondary entry point into the existing context-driven feature execution pipeline.
- Resolve execution specs deterministically from `docs/features/<feature>/specs/<NNN-name>.md`.
- Block execution when execution-spec instructions conflict with canonical feature truth.

**Reasoning**
- This preserves the rule that the canonical feature spec remains authoritative.
- This reuses the existing doctor, alignment, verification, repair, and execution behavior instead of creating a second policy path.
- This keeps execution-spec usage explainable and deterministic for CI and agent workflows.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Make execution specs authoritative after implementation.
- Duplicate the implement feature orchestration in a second command path.
- Allow execution specs to silently override canonical feature behavior.

**Impact**
- Foundry can now execute bounded implementation work orders without weakening canonical context authority.
- `implement spec` remains aligned with the existing blocked, repaired, or completed execution contract.

### Decision: derive the next execution spec from canonical feature context
Timestamp: 2026-04-10T12:15:00-04:00

**Context**
- Foundry could execute bounded work from canonical context and secondary execution specs, but it still lacked a public planning entry point.
- Future execution needed a deterministic way to create the next bounded work order without making execution specs authoritative.

**Decision**
- Add `plan feature` as a deterministic planning command.
- Derive one bounded execution spec at a time from the canonical feature spec, feature state, and decision ledger.

**Reasoning**
- Planning should reuse the existing context gate instead of inventing a separate planning policy path.
- Canonical feature context must remain authoritative even when Foundry generates secondary execution specs automatically.
- Generating one bounded execution spec at a time keeps planning explicit and reproducible instead of drifting into roadmap generation.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Leave execution-spec creation manual.
- Generate multi-step roadmaps from canonical context.
- Allow planning from prompt-only context outside the canonical files.

**Impact**
- Foundry can now generate the next bounded execution spec deterministically from canonical feature context.
- Generated execution specs remain secondary work orders that are immediately usable by `implement spec`.

**Context**
- The first auto-planning implementation could still produce execution specs with vague or self-referential wording when the remaining unmatched spec gap was too abstract.
- Foundry needed planner output that stays actionable and bounded rather than emitting low-value work orders.

**Decision**
- Refine `plan feature` to derive concrete planning gaps from Expected Behavior versus Current State.
- Generate differentiated purpose, scope, requested changes, and slug output only for meaningful concrete gaps.
- Block planning when the remaining gap is abstract or non-actionable.

**Reasoning**
- A blocked result is safer than generating an execution spec that looks valid but does not actually guide implementation.
- Concrete spec-state gaps are a more reliable planning input than vague high-level future statements.
- This keeps planning deterministic without weakening canonical feature authority or inventing a second planning policy path.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep generating execution specs from any unmatched spec or next-step text.
- Add fuzzy semantic or LLM-based planning heuristics.
- Solve low-quality plans by rewriting canonical context automatically.

**Impact**
- Planner output is now narrower, clearer, and less tautological.
- `plan feature` now fails cleanly when canonical context does not identify a meaningful next implementation step.

### Decision: enforce planner determinism and reproducibility guarantees
Timestamp: 2026-04-10T13:45:00-04:00

**Context**
- Planner output quality had improved, but the system still needed strong guarantees that identical canonical inputs would always produce identical planning results.
- Non-deterministic planning would weaken CI reliability, reproducibility, and trust in generated execution specs.

**Decision**
- Normalize planning input into a stable deterministic structure before handing it to the planner.
- Guarantee identical planned or blocked results for identical canonical inputs.

**Reasoning**
- The planner must behave like a pure function of canonical context.
- Deterministic planning is required for automation, debugging, and stable downstream execution-spec generation.
- Stable ordering should preserve author-meaningful sequencing where that sequencing is itself canonical input.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Accept planner nondeterminism as harmless.
- Add retries or “best of several” planning attempts.
- Defer reproducibility hardening until later phases.

**Impact**
- Planner output is now stable across repeated runs with identical input.
- Blocked planning responses are reproducible.
- Planning is safer to use in automated workflows and tests.

### Decision: render generated execution specs from a canonical stub template
Timestamp: 2026-04-10T14:15:00-04:00

**Context**
- Planner quality and determinism were in place, but generated execution specs were still assembled inline.
- Inline assembly risked structural drift between generated specs over time.

**Decision**
- Add a canonical execution-spec stub template.
- Render generated execution specs by merging planner content into the stub instead of assembling markdown structure inline.

**Reasoning**
- A single template keeps structure centralized and easier to evolve safely.
- This separates planner responsibility for content from renderer responsibility for structure.
- Canonical stub rendering reduces structural drift while preserving deterministic output.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep inline string assembly in the planner.
- Duplicate execution-spec structure logic across multiple planner paths.
- Introduce a full templating engine.

**Impact**
- Generated execution specs now share one canonical structure.
- Future structural changes can be made in one place without rewriting planner content logic.
- Planner content quality and structural rendering are now cleanly separated.

### Decision: allow a one-time execution-spec renumbering correction in context-persistence
Timestamp: 2026-04-17T10:30:00-04:00

**Context**
- The `context-persistence` execution specs drifted out of intended numeric implementation order.
- In particular, `020-fails-when-doctor-repairable` had already been implemented while `019` remained unimplemented, which broke the intended sequential order within the feature.
- Foundry’s normal rule is that execution-spec ids are immutable once assigned, but this case was identified as a one-time cleanup to restore coherent feature-local sequencing.

**Decision**
- Allow a one-time renumbering correction within `context-persistence` so the already-implemented spec becomes `019-fails-when-doctor-repairable` and the unimplemented draft becomes `020-keep-later-systems-safely`.
- Treat this as an explicit exception rather than a precedent for ordinary execution-spec renumbering.

**Reasoning**
- This preserves the intended sequential implementation order within the feature.
- It keeps the active historical sequence easier to read for humans and agents.
- The exception is narrow, documented, and applied before further work continued, which minimizes ambiguity.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Leave the numbering as-is and tolerate the gap/order mismatch.
- Renumber all later drafts more broadly.
- Preserve immutability strictly even though the sequence was already known to be misordered.

**Impact**
- `context-persistence` execution-spec numbering is now coherent again after `018.001`.
- Future ids return to being immutable after this correction.
- The implementation log and references were updated to reflect the corrected id mapping.

### Decision: derive a strict consumability gate from verify-context outputs
Timestamp: 2026-04-17T11:45:00-04:00

**Context**
- `verify context` already combined doctor and alignment into a deterministic view, but downstream execution still treated alignment warnings as runnable.
- Execution spec 020 required a stricter machine-readable answer for whether canonical context is safe for later systems to consume without guessing or partial state.
- The stricter gate could not rewrite doctor or alignment behavior because those outputs were already part of the feature contract.

**Decision**
- Derive a per-feature `consumable` flag inside `verify context`.
- Define `consumable = true` only when doctor status is `ok`, alignment status is `ok`, and required actions are empty.
- Keep existing verify pass/fail status semantics, but make repo-wide `can_proceed` depend on every feature being consumable.
- Make context-driven execution surfaces refuse with deterministic `context_not_consumable` guidance when the consumability gate is false, while still allowing explicit repair modes to resolve deterministic required actions first.

**Reasoning**
- Consumability is stricter than pass/fail readiness and captures whether downstream systems can safely trust the canonical context as-is.
- Deriving the flag from existing outputs preserves deterministic behavior and avoids inventing a second diagnostics system.
- Reusing one refusal reason keeps later execution surfaces consistent without weakening the repair-first workflow.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Change doctor or alignment rules directly to encode consumability.
- Treat alignment warnings as consumable for execution.
- Add a separate ad hoc refusal policy inside each execution command.

**Impact**
- `verify context` now exposes a stricter downstream safety signal without breaking its existing doctor/alignment contracts.
- Repo-wide verification can now report `can_proceed = false` when any feature is still non-consumable even if per-feature statuses remain `pass`.
- `implement feature` and `implement spec` now fail closed on non-consumable canonical context and surface one deterministic refusal message.
