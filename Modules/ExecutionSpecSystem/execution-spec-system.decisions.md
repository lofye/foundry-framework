### Decision: establish execution-spec-system as a standalone feature
Timestamp: 2026-04-14T10:03:15-04:00

**Context**
- Foundry already supported planning and executing bounded work from `docs/features/`, but the naming contract for execution specs was inconsistent across code, templates, and existing documents.
- Hierarchical padded ids and filename-only headings needed a clear canonical home.

**Decision**
- Create a standalone feature named `execution-spec-system`.
- Treat execution-spec naming, identity, heading, and placement rules as their own feature instead of folding them into an unrelated cleanup bucket.

**Reasoning**
- The execution-spec contract is cross-cutting and affects planners, resolvers, docs, and human workflows.
- A dedicated feature keeps the naming policy explicit and easier to evolve without obscuring why the rules exist.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep the work implicit inside `context-persistence`.
- Fold the changes into a broad documentation cleanup.

**Impact**
- Execution-spec naming now has a feature-owned canonical spec, state document, and decision history.
- Future changes to execution-spec hierarchy or allocation can build on a clear source of truth.

### Decision: keep filename identity canonical while leaving CLI lookup feature-qualified
Timestamp: 2026-04-14T10:04:00-04:00

**Context**
- The new naming contract makes the filename the canonical execution-spec identity, but CLI workflows still need an unambiguous way to locate a spec within a feature directory.
- Existing `plan feature` and `implement spec` flows already exchange feature-qualified refs such as `event-bus/001-contract-test-coverage`.

**Decision**
- Make the filename and its hierarchical id the canonical identity and heading source for execution specs.
- Keep fully qualified CLI lookup refs in the form `<feature>/<id>-<slug>` while still allowing unique filename shorthand resolution.

**Reasoning**
- This preserves unambiguous lookup without reintroducing duplicated identity inside the spec file itself.
- It keeps existing CLI workflows stable while moving canonical identity to the filename where the hierarchy actually lives.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Change all CLI references to filename-only ids immediately.
- Keep feature-prefixed headings and treat the path as the canonical identity.

**Impact**
- Resolver and planner behavior now align with the new filename contract without breaking the existing feature-qualified lookup flow.
- Future tooling can expose both canonical filename identity and convenient feature-qualified refs without conflating them.

### Decision: block framework-repository execution specs before app-feature scaffolding
Timestamp: 2026-04-15T09:16:09-04:00

**Context**
- `implement spec execution-spec-system/004-spec-auto-log-on-implementation` in the framework repository routed through `ContextExecutionService::execute()` and the generic `FeatureGenerator`, which created accidental files under `app/features/execution-spec-system/`.
- Those files are application scaffold output, not valid framework-feature implementation artifacts.
- The framework repository needs an explicit safe failure mode until a dedicated framework-internal implementation path exists.

**Decision**
- When `implement spec` runs inside the framework repository, block execution specs before the generic `app/features/*` scaffold path.
- Return an explicit deterministic blocked result instead of creating or modifying application feature scaffolds for framework-internal work.

**Reasoning**
- The generic app-feature generator writes source-of-truth files that the framework compiler and runtime immediately treat as real application features.
- Blocking early prevents misplaced output from becoming live accidental input.
- An explicit block is safer than pretending framework execution succeeded through the wrong destination.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep routing framework execution specs through the generic app scaffold flow.
- Add a full dedicated framework-internal implementation path in the same change.
- Allow scaffold generation and clean it up later.

**Impact**
- Framework-repository execution specs no longer create `app/features/<feature>/` scaffolds.
- `implement spec` now fails honestly for framework-internal work until a dedicated framework execution path exists.
- Existing application-project behavior remains unchanged because the block applies only inside the framework repository.

### Decision: narrow canonical conflict detection to forbidden-action evidence
Timestamp: 2026-04-15T00:53:58-04:00

**Context**
- `implement spec` was raising `EXECUTION_SPEC_CONFLICTS_WITH_CANONICAL_SPEC` for execution specs that were aligned with the canonical feature spec but happened to share several topic words with canonical negative constraints.
- The known false positive was the auto-log execution spec, where an instruction to append implementation-log entries overlapped lexically with the canonical logging constraint without contradicting it.
- Canonical feature authority still needed to be preserved for real conflicts such as renaming immutable ids or instructing forbidden draft execution.

**Decision**
- Narrow canonical conflict detection so that lexical topic overlap alone is no longer sufficient evidence of contradiction.
- Compare only positive execution-spec instruction items against forbidden clauses extracted from canonical non-goals and negative constraints.
- Keep the existing blocked result contract unchanged for true conflicts.

**Reasoning**
- Shared nouns show subject matter, not contradiction.
- Restricting comparison to positive execution instructions avoids treating aligned negative guardrails in execution specs as if they were conflicting with canonical guardrails.
- A deterministic forbidden-clause comparison keeps canonical protection in place without introducing probabilistic semantic inference.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep the raw token-overlap heuristic and reword execution specs to avoid overlapping nouns.
- Remove canonical conflict detection entirely.
- Replace the heuristic with an LLM-backed contradiction detector.

**Impact**
- Aligned execution specs that reinforce canonical behavior are no longer blocked falsely during `implement spec`.
- True contradictions against canonical non-goals or negative constraints still raise `EXECUTION_SPEC_CONFLICTS_WITH_CANONICAL_SPEC`.
- Conflict detection remains deterministic, testable, and conservative without relying on brittle topic overlap.

### Decision: auto-log successful active execution-spec completion
Timestamp: 2026-04-14T23:35:32-04:00

**Context**
- The implementation-log format is already part of the execution-spec naming policy, but recording entries still depended on a manual follow-up after successful `implement spec` runs.
- Missing manual log updates weaken chronology and make the policy easy to skip even when active execution-spec implementation succeeded.

**Decision**
- Automatically append implementation-log entries when an active execution spec completes successfully through `implement spec`.
- Skip draft paths, prevent duplicate entries for the same active spec, and surface log-write failures as explicit implementation issues.

**Reasoning**
- Logging belongs in the execution-spec lifecycle contract, not as a separate human reminder.
- Idempotent append behavior prevents accidental duplicate chronology while keeping successful completion scriptable.
- Surfacing write failures inside the spec-execution result avoids silently claiming a clean success when the required log entry is missing.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep implementation-log updates manual.
- Append log entries from the CLI wrapper instead of the execution service.
- Ignore log-write failures and leave the implementation result as completed.

**Impact**
- Active execution-spec completion now keeps project chronology current automatically.
- Draft specs remain non-executable planning artifacts and are not recorded as implemented.
- Implement-spec callers now get a deterministic error path when the required implementation log cannot be written.

### Decision: add a dedicated `spec:validate` CLI command for execution-spec rule enforcement
Timestamp: 2026-04-14T15:19:39-04:00

**Context**
- Execution-spec naming and placement rules are now documented and draft creation is deterministic, but there was still no single command to check repository-wide spec state before planning or implementation.
- Allocation already blocks on invalid spec state, which means developers and agents need a direct way to inspect all violations without mutating files.

**Decision**
- Add a dedicated `spec:validate` command that scans active and draft execution specs under `docs/features/`.
- Report canonical filename, placement, heading, duplicate-id, and forbidden-metadata violations without modifying any files.

**Reasoning**
- A read-only validator gives agents and developers one deterministic entry point for enforcing the spec naming policy.
- Reporting every violation in one run reduces repair loops and keeps allocation failures easier to diagnose.
- Reusing the same canonical rules across docs, planning, creation, and validation reduces drift.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep validation implicit inside allocation and resolver failures only.
- Repair violations automatically during validation.
- Validate only one feature at a time instead of scanning the whole spec tree.

**Impact**
- Execution-spec rule enforcement is now explicit and scriptable.
- Invalid repository state can be diagnosed before `plan feature`, `spec:new`, or manual implementation work.

**Spec Reference**

### Decision: reuse one catalog for planner allocation and draft creation
Timestamp: 2026-04-14T14:05:00-04:00

**Context**
- `plan feature` already needed deterministic root-ID allocation, and `spec:new` now needs the same allocation rules plus clearer failure behavior when feature spec state is invalid.
- Duplicating directory scans and ID selection would create drift between planner-created specs and manually created drafts.

**Decision**
- Introduce one shared execution-spec catalog that scans active and draft specs, detects invalid or duplicate ID state, and allocates the next root ID.
- Reuse that catalog from both `ContextPlanningService` and `spec:new`.

**Reasoning**
- A shared catalog keeps allocation rules deterministic in one place.
- Validation of duplicate IDs and invalid spec filenames should be consistent regardless of which command is allocating the next spec.
- This avoids maintaining separate allocation heuristics for planner output and CLI draft creation.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep planner allocation private and duplicate similar logic inside `spec:new`.
- Let `spec:new` ignore invalid spec state and attempt best-effort allocation.

**Impact**
- Planner and draft creation now share one allocation source of truth.
- Invalid execution-spec state blocks allocation consistently instead of producing divergent behavior.

**Spec Reference**
- Goals
- Constraints
- Expected Behavior

### Decision: add a dedicated `spec:new` CLI command for deterministic draft creation
Timestamp: 2026-04-14T13:34:01-04:00

**Context**
- Execution-spec naming and allocation rules are now explicit, but draft creation still requires manual path construction and manual root-ID selection.
- The next execution spec for this feature defines a stable CLI contract for creating drafts safely.

**Decision**
- Add a dedicated `spec:new` command that creates draft execution specs under `docs/features/<feature>/specs/drafts/`.
- Reuse canonical allocation rules, deterministic slug normalization, and filename-only headings for generated drafts.

**Reasoning**
- Draft creation should use the same canonical naming contract that planning and resolution already enforce.
- A dedicated CLI surface reduces ID collisions and keeps agent and human workflows aligned.
- Stable plain-text output makes the command safer for both terminal use and automation.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Leave draft creation manual.
- Hide draft creation inside `plan feature`.
- Create drafts with interactive prompts instead of a deterministic command contract.

**Impact**
- Execution-spec creation becomes a first-class deterministic workflow instead of an undocumented manual step.
- Later validation and lifecycle tooling can build on the same shared draft-creation rules.

### Decision: clarify auto-log failure semantics as partial success, not clean success
Timestamp: 2026-04-15T14:05:00-04:00

**Context**
- Automatic implementation-log append is now part of active execution-spec completion.
- In the implemented behavior, log-write failures do not erase the already-completed implementation work, but they also must not be reported as a clean success.
- The canonical feature spec and the execution spec needed an explicit decision clarifying how this outcome should be represented.

**Decision**
- When active execution-spec implementation succeeds but the required implementation-log append fails, the result must surface clearly and deterministically as a partial-success outcome such as `completed_with_issues`.
- This outcome must not be reported as a clean successful completion.
- Draft specs still remain ineligible for implementation logging.

**Reasoning**
- A hard clean-failure result would overstate what went wrong by implying the implementation itself did not complete.
- A clean success would understate what went wrong by hiding the missing required log entry.
- A partial-success result preserves both truths: implementation completed, but required post-completion logging did not.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Treat log-write failure as a hard failure of the entire implementation.
- Ignore log-write failure and report a clean success.
- Keep log updates manual.

**Impact**
- The canonical execution-spec-system contract now explicitly allows `completed_with_issues`-style results for implementation-log append failures.
- `implement spec` remains truthful about execution outcomes without silently skipping required chronology updates.
- Execution specs and canonical feature docs can align on one clear partial-success model.

### Decision: context-driven execution for execution-spec-system

Timestamp: <ISO-8601>

**Context**

- Foundry executed feature work for `execution-spec-system` from canonical context artifacts.

**Decision**

- Use the canonical spec, state, and decision ledger as the deterministic execution input.
- Update feature context after execution and revalidate before finishing.

**Reasoning**

- This keeps feature execution traceable to the canonical context contract.
- This preserves fail-closed behavior when repair is still required.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Execute from ad hoc prompts only.
- Skip post-execution context updates.
- Repair context only after implementation.

**Impact**

- Feature execution now leaves an explicit context trail.
- Later runs can resume from updated state instead of relying on chat history.

**Spec Reference**

### Decision: add exact feature-plus-id shorthand for active execution-spec resolution
Timestamp: 2026-04-16T09:46:00-04:00

**Context**

- The filename remains the canonical execution-spec identity, but `implement spec` still required either the full `<feature>/<id>-<slug>` ref or a globally unique filename shorthand.
- In practice, users often know the feature and canonical id before they need the slug text.
- Any shorthand still needed to preserve active-only resolution and deterministic failure semantics.

**Decision**

- Accept `implement spec <feature> <id>` as a deterministic lookup form for active execution specs.
- Match the canonical hierarchical id exactly within the provided feature and fail clearly for malformed ids, unknown features, unknown active ids, draft-only matches, or ambiguous duplicates.

**Reasoning**

- Feature-plus-id shorthand improves ergonomics without changing filename identity.
- Scoping the lookup to one feature preserves determinism and avoids guessing across unrelated execution specs.
- Explicit failure modes keep the active-versus-draft lifecycle contract intact.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Keep only the full feature-qualified ref.
- Rely only on unique global filename shorthand.
- Add fuzzy slug or partial-id matching.

**Impact**

- `implement spec` can now be invoked more quickly when the feature and id are already known.
- Canonical filename identity, active-only execution, and deterministic blocked results remain unchanged.
- The CLI help and reference docs now surface the shorthand explicitly.

### Decision: enforce implementation-log coverage during deterministic spec validation
Timestamp: 2026-04-17T12:15:00-04:00

**Context**

- Automatic implementation-log appends already covered newly completed active execution specs, but older promoted specs could still exist without a corresponding entry in `docs/features/implementation-log.md`.
- `spec:validate` already served as the deterministic repository-wide execution-spec verification surface, yet it did not enforce this part of the lifecycle contract.
- Draft specs still needed to remain exempt because they are planning artifacts rather than completed active work.

**Decision**

- Extend `spec:validate` to require an exact matching implementation-log entry for every active canonical execution spec.
- Continue exempting specs under `docs/features/<feature>/specs/drafts/`.
- Treat missing coverage as a deterministic validation violation rather than a best-effort warning.

**Reasoning**

- The implementation log is part of the execution-spec lifecycle contract, so validation should enforce it just like filename, heading, and placement rules.
- Exact matching keeps the rule deterministic and machine-readable without adding fuzzy historical inference.
- Reusing `spec:validate` is narrower and clearer than inventing a separate audit command for the same repository state.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Keep implementation-log coverage as a documentation convention only.
- Enforce the rule only during `implement spec` and never re-check repository state later.
- Add fuzzy matching or infer implementation history from other repository signals.

**Impact**

- Missing implementation-log coverage for active specs is now detectable through the standard execution-spec verification path.
- Draft specs remain out of scope for implementation chronology.
- Repository validation can now surface incomplete execution-spec history deterministically instead of relying on memory.

**Spec Reference**

- Constraints
- Expected Behavior
- Acceptance Criteria

### Decision: add an explicit exact log-entry suggestion surface for active specs
Timestamp: 2026-04-17T13:00:00-04:00

**Context**

- `spec:validate` now enforces exact implementation-log coverage for active execution specs, but humans and agents still had to reconstruct the required entry content from docs or memory before appending it.
- The canonical log format was already explicit and deterministic, so the remaining gap was outputting that exact content on demand without broadening into automatic backfill logic.
- Draft specs still needed to remain exempt from implementation chronology.

**Decision**

- Add a dedicated `spec:log-entry` command that resolves one active execution spec and emits the exact canonical implementation-log entry content.
- Reuse canonical execution-spec resolution and the implementation-log formatter so the suggested content matches validation exactly.
- Fail clearly for draft-only, malformed, or unknown targets instead of guessing or generating draft log entries.

**Reasoning**

- A small explicit CLI surface is easier to trust and automate than asking users to reassemble the format manually.
- Reusing the same formatter that automatic append logic already uses keeps the command aligned with both implementation and validation contracts.
- Keeping drafts out of scope preserves the active-versus-draft lifecycle boundary.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Leave log-entry construction manual.
- Add suggestion data only to validation failures instead of providing a direct command.
- Auto-append or auto-backfill missing entries in the same change.

**Impact**

- Humans and agents can now request exact canonical log-entry content without guessing.
- Validation, suggestion, and automatic append behavior now share one formatting contract.
- Draft execution specs remain non-chronological planning artifacts until promotion and completion.

### Decision: align agent-facing path contracts to canonical feature docs layout
Timestamp: 2026-05-02T14:01:00-04:00

**Context**
- Active execution spec `007.002-agent-facing-doc-path-contracts` requires agent-facing guidance to use the canonical feature-doc path layout and reject stale active path guidance.
- Several agent-facing files still referenced legacy `docs/specs/*` locations or omitted canonical draft-spec, plan, and implementation-log path guidance.

**Decision**
- Update framework-level and app-level agent instruction surfaces to use canonical feature context paths at `docs/features/<feature>/<feature>.*`.
- Update agent-facing instruction surfaces to include canonical draft spec, plan, and implementation-log paths.
- Update repository-local strict implementation skills to reference `docs/features/<feature>/specs/<id>-<slug>.md` and `docs/features/implementation-log.md`.

**Reasoning**
- A single deterministic path contract reduces agent routing errors and prevents stale-file writes.
- Keeping framework and scaffolded app instructions aligned preserves consistent behavior across repository and initialized apps.
- Updating strict skills removes legacy path guidance from the execution workflow most likely to be reused by agents.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Restrict updates to `AGENTS.md` only.
- Keep stale path references and rely on migration memory.

**Impact**
- Agent-facing active guidance now points to canonical feature-doc paths and canonical implementation-log location.
- Legacy `docs/specs/*` references remain only in historical, migration, or explicit invalid-path contexts.
- Verification workflows continue to pass with the updated path contract.

### Decision: align README and public documentation path contracts to canonical feature docs layout
Timestamp: 2026-05-02T14:10:00-04:00

**Context**
- Active execution spec `007.003-readmes-stubs-and-public-docs-path-contracts` requires human-facing docs and scaffold-oriented documentation to use canonical feature-doc paths.
- The repository still needed explicit canonical path distinctions in `docs/features/README.md` for draft specs, implementation plans, and the global implementation log.

**Decision**
- Align human-facing README/policy surfaces with canonical feature context stems (`docs/features/<feature>/<feature>.*`).
- Keep execution-spec examples under `docs/features/<feature>/specs/` and draft-spec examples under `docs/features/<feature>/specs/drafts/`.
- Ensure docs explicitly distinguish feature-local plans (`docs/features/<feature>/plans/*.md`) from the global implementation ledger (`docs/features/implementation-log.md`).

**Reasoning**
- Human-facing docs are frequently copied into new app and contributor workflows, so stale examples can propagate invalid path contracts.
- Explicitly separating specs, drafts, plans, and the implementation log reduces ambiguity for both manual and agent-assisted workflows.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Update only top-level README files and defer `docs/features/README.md`.
- Leave implicit distinctions and rely on agent-specific instructions only.

**Impact**
- Human-facing active guidance now mirrors the canonical feature-doc contract used by agent-facing instructions.
- Remaining stale-path references stay limited to explicit historical, migration, or invalid-path contexts.
- Verification and context alignment remain deterministic and clean.

### Decision: align planning fixtures and contract tests to draft execution-spec path expectations
Timestamp: 2026-05-02T14:30:00-04:00

**Context**
- Active execution spec `007.004-path-fixtures-tests-and-contract-cleanup` requires test and fixture contracts to reflect canonical feature-doc paths and to limit stale-path usage to explicit invalid-path coverage.
- Several planning-related tests still described generated execution specs under `docs/features/<feature>/specs/<id>-<slug>.md` instead of the canonical planner draft path.

**Decision**
- Update planning-oriented test fixtures and expectations to use `docs/features/<feature>/specs/drafts/<id>-<slug>.md` for planner-produced specs.
- Keep implementation-log assertions on `docs/features/implementation-log.md` and preserve deterministic contract output behavior.
- Treat stale active-path patterns as invalid except where tests explicitly cover invalid-path handling.

**Reasoning**
- Planner output is draft-first by contract, so tests must assert the same path semantics to prevent drift.
- Deterministic test contracts should fail on stale assumptions rather than silently accepting old path behavior.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep existing planning test phrasing and rely on surrounding docs for clarification.
- Introduce path normalization in tests instead of correcting explicit expected strings.

**Impact**
- Planning fixture expectations now match canonical draft execution-spec placement.
- Test contracts better enforce canonical path boundaries and reduce future migration regressions.
- Validation and context alignment remain clean after fixture contract updates.

**Spec Reference**
- Purpose
- Required Cleanup
- Invalid Active Test Assumptions

### Decision: add deterministic implementation-plan files and strict active-plan enforcement
Timestamp: 2026-05-02T15:05:00-04:00

**Context**
- Active execution spec `008-implementation-plan-files` requires first-class implementation plan files tied to active execution specs before implementation begins.
- Prior CLI surfaces supported draft spec creation, log-entry suggestion, and spec validation, but did not provide a deterministic command for creating plan files or strict active-plan enforcement in validation.

**Decision**
- Add `spec:plan <feature> <id>` to create `docs/features/<feature>/plans/<id>-<slug>.md` from active execution specs using a canonical implementation-plan stub.
- Extend `spec:validate` to validate plan placement, heading, filename/spec correspondence, duplicate plan IDs, and forbidden metadata fields.
- Add `spec:validate --require-plans` to require plans for active execution specs only, while excluding draft execution specs from required plan coverage.

**Reasoning**
- Persisted plan files make implementation strategy inspectable and resumable without making plans authoritative over execution specs.
- Deterministic path and heading validation prevents silent drift between execution specs and their implementation plans.
- Optional strict enforcement avoids forcing immediate backfill for historical completed specs while enabling tighter gates for new work.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep planning as chat-only guidance without persisted files.
- Make plan enforcement mandatory by default for all active specs.
- Reuse draft spec templates instead of a dedicated implementation-plan stub.

**Impact**
- New active spec workflows can produce deterministic plan artifacts before implementation.
- Validation now catches orphan, misplaced, malformed, duplicate, and metadata-invalid plan files.
- Strict mode can enforce active plan coverage when teams opt in.

### Decision: enforce sequential execution-spec ID continuity as a fail-closed contract
Timestamp: 2026-05-02T16:10:00-04:00

**Context**
- Active execution spec `009-enforce-sequential-execution-spec-ids` requires execution-spec IDs to behave as ordered contracts instead of optional labels.
- Prior behavior allowed workflows to continue when a feature skipped numeric IDs, which made later specs, plans, and log entries appear valid while earlier required sequence slots were missing.

**Decision**
- Enforce deterministic contiguous execution-spec IDs across active and draft specs within each feature at every hierarchy level.
- Treat top-level gaps, child-segment gaps, and missing-parent IDs as validation failures.
- Make execution-spec workflows that allocate, plan, or emit execution-spec log guidance fail closed when continuity is broken.

**Reasoning**
- Ordered IDs preserve deterministic progression and reduce ambiguity about implementation order and feature history.
- Continuity checks across active plus draft scopes prevent side-channel bypasses where drafts could skip ahead silently.
- Fail-closed workflow behavior keeps tooling aligned with the contract instead of allowing partial enforcement.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep continuity as a soft warning and allow command execution.
- Enforce only top-level continuity while ignoring child-segment gaps.
- Enforce continuity only for active specs and ignore drafts.

**Impact**
- `spec:validate` now reports deterministic ID-gap violations and rejects skipped implementation-log sequences.
- `spec:new`, `spec:plan`, and `spec:log-entry` now refuse to proceed when feature continuity is invalid.
- Agent-facing and human-facing documentation now explicitly states that skipping execution-spec IDs is forbidden.

### Decision: enforce gapless IDs per feature with active/draft continuity separation
Timestamp: 2026-05-02T16:08:00-04:00

**Context**
- Active execution spec `010-enforce-feature-scoped-gapless-spec-ids` requires ID continuity to remain feature-scoped and sibling-scoped while validating active and draft sequences independently.
- Prior continuity enforcement treated active and draft specs as one combined continuity set, which could hide draft-only gaps behind active history.

**Decision**
- Enforce gapless sequencing per feature and sibling group with independent continuity checks for `active` and `drafts` locations.
- Keep hierarchical missing-parent and sibling-gap detection deterministic.
- Keep command behavior fail-closed for ID-allocation and spec lifecycle commands when continuity is invalid.

**Reasoning**
- Feature-scoped isolation prevents unrelated features from influencing ID validation.
- Location-separated continuity keeps draft quality strict without coupling it to active implementation history.
- Deterministic details make repair workflows automatable and unambiguous.

**Alternatives Considered**
- Keep active and draft continuity coupled in one sequence.
- Enforce a repository-global sequence across features.
- Auto-renumber invalid sequences.

**Impact**
- `spec:validate` now reports deterministic gap details including feature, location, parent group, missing ID, next observed ID, and offending path.
- `spec:new` and related spec lifecycle flows continue to fail closed when continuity is invalid.
- Context docs now explicitly state active-vs-draft continuity separation.
