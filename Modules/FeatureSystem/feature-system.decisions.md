### Decision: adopt canonical Features workspace with migration-safe compatibility

Timestamp: 2026-05-03T23:15:00-04:00

**Context**

- The repository previously used `docs/features/*` as the only feature-doc workspace.
- The feature-system execution spec requires canonical `Features/` ownership with deterministic migration compatibility.

**Decision**

- Implement canonical `Features/` discovery and CLI inspection/verification surfaces.
- Keep legacy `docs/features/*` readable while preferring canonical paths when both exist.
- Treat `Features/implementation.log` as canonical implementation-ledger location when canonical workspace is present.

**Reasoning**

- Canonical co-location reduces cross-repository lookup cost for humans and agents.
- Compatibility avoids destabilizing existing workflows during incremental migration.
- Deterministic diagnostics make duplication and enforcement drift explicit instead of hidden.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Keep `docs/features/*` as permanent canonical path.
- Hard-cut migration with no compatibility bridge.
- Delay CLI and validation support until a full repository migration.

**Impact**

- Feature workspace inspection and boundary verification now support canonical and legacy layouts.
- Spec validation accepts canonical `Features/*` execution spec and plan paths.
- Implementation-log path semantics now recognize canonical `Features/implementation.log`.

### Decision: allow migration-phase state details that exceed the current canonical spec wording

Timestamp: 2026-05-03T23:28:00-04:00

**Context**

- The Current State documents concrete implementation details (diagnostic codes, canonical/legacy compatibility behavior, and migration notes).
- Some of those details are more specific than the current spec text and can appear as state-spec divergence during alignment checks.

**Decision**

- Keep the Current State details as implemented behavior and treat them as an explicit migration-phase refinement.
- Use this decision entry as the supporting reference for state claims that are more specific than the current spec wording.

**Reasoning**

- The state document should remain truthful about what is actually implemented.
- Recording the divergence explicitly is safer than deleting implemented details or over-broadening the spec contract prematurely.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Remove specific state claims so alignment appears strict but less informative.
- Expand the spec immediately with every implementation detail.

**Impact**

- Alignment tooling can treat the documented divergence as intentional and decision-backed.
- Current State retains implementation-useful detail during incremental migration.

### Decision: document migration-phase state claims as explicit divergence references

Timestamp: 2026-05-03T23:35:00-04:00

**Context**

- Current State includes migration-phase implementation claims that can be more specific than existing spec phrasing.

**Decision**

- Deterministic `feature:list`, `feature:inspect <feature>`, `feature:map`, and `verify features` CLI surfaces are available.
- `Features/implementation.log` is used when canonical workspace is present.
- `spec:validate` supports canonical `Features/*/specs` and `Features/*/plans`.
- Legacy `docs/features/*` inputs remain readable during migration.
- Canonical and legacy duplicate definitions produce deterministic diagnostics.
- Boundary enforcement defaults to enabled and disabled mode emits visible warnings.

**Reasoning**

- Keeping explicit migration-phase details in both state and decisions preserves truthful implementation context while allowing intentional divergence tracking.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Remove migration-phase implementation details from Current State.
- Delay canonical workspace reporting until a full physical migration is complete.

**Impact**

- Decision ledger now explicitly references the implemented migration-phase state claims.
- Alignment tooling can treat these claims as decision-backed during incremental migration.

### Decision: migrate framework governance workspace from Features to Modules with deterministic compatibility guards

Timestamp: 2026-05-06T12:05:00-04:00

**Context**

- Execution spec `003-separate-framework-modules-from-application-features` requires framework-owned governance directories to move from `Features/` to `Modules/`.
- Framework context/spec/plan/log resolution and validation services still treated `Features/` as the canonical root for framework governance.

**Decision**

- Move framework governance directories and implementation log to `Modules/*` and `Modules/implementation.log`.
- Update context/spec/planning resolution, validation, and feature verification services to discover canonical framework module governance from `Modules/*`.
- Keep deterministic compatibility for legacy `Features/*` and `docs/features/*` paths while emitting deterministic violations for misplaced framework modules under `Features/` when `Modules/` is present.

**Reasoning**

- Separating framework module governance from application feature ownership removes namespace ambiguity and aligns with the module-vs-feature contract.
- Deterministic compatibility reduces migration risk while preserving strict failure semantics for incorrect canonical placement.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Keep `Features/` as canonical and defer migration.
- Hard-remove all legacy compatibility in the same step.

**Impact**

- Framework governance canonical root is now `Modules/`.
- Validation and resolver surfaces now support `Modules/*` canonical placement and canonical `Modules/implementation.log` discovery.
- Misplaced framework module directories remaining under `Features/` become deterministic verification failures when `Modules/` exists.

- Required Layout
- Migration Requirements
- Resolver And Validator Updates
- Legacy Compatibility Rule
- Deterministic Error Requirements
