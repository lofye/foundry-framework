### Decision: create canonical generate-engine context around the existing generate workflow and track interactive review as the next bounded step

Timestamp: 2026-04-21T10:30:00-04:00

**Context**

- The repository already ships a substantial `generate` implementation with deterministic planning, validation, execution, verification, confidence reporting, git safety checks, and explain snapshot support.
- Execution specs existed under `docs/generate-engine/specs/`, but the canonical feature spec, state document, and decision ledger had never been created.
- Work on `001-interactive-generate-plan-review` requires canonical context before runtime behavior can change.

**Decision**

- Create `generate-engine` as a standalone canonical feature.
- Ground the feature spec in the existing non-interactive generate workflow.
- Track interactive plan review, approval, minimal modification, and risk gating as the next bounded implementation step for this feature.

**Reasoning**

- The generate engine is already a meaningful subsystem with its own CLI contract, safety model, and verification path.
- Canonical context must describe current reality first so alignment checks can distinguish implemented behavior from pending work.
- Framing interactive review as the next bounded step lets the repository proceed compliantly without inventing a second planning surface or hiding missing behavior.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Keep relying on execution specs without canonical feature context.
- Fold generate-engine concerns into an unrelated feature such as `cli-experience`.
- Write the canonical spec as if interactive review were already implemented.

**Impact**

- `generate-engine` now has canonical spec, state, and decision files that reflect the existing implementation and pending interactive work.
- Context verification can gate future generate-engine changes against an authoritative source of truth.
- `001-interactive-generate-plan-review` can proceed as an implementation step once the repaired context passes validation.

### Decision: keep interactive generate review as an explicit spec-state divergence until execution spec 001 is implemented

Timestamp: 2026-04-21T10:35:00-04:00

**Context**

- The canonical `generate-engine` spec now records the intended interactive review, approval, modification, and risk-gating behavior.
- The current implementation still only exposes the non-interactive generate workflow.
- The state document needs to say plainly that interactive generate review, pre-apply plan editing, and interactive decision capture are not implemented yet.

**Decision**

- Allow the canonical spec to describe the intended interactive end-state now.
- Record the current absence of `--interactive` review behavior as a temporary, explicit spec-state divergence until `001-interactive-generate-plan-review` lands.

**Reasoning**

- The feature spec should preserve the intended contract for the generate engine instead of collapsing to only today’s implementation details.
- The state document must remain truthful about the current CLI and payload behavior.
- Logging the gap in the decision ledger lets context validation distinguish intentional pending work from accidental drift.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Rewrite the feature spec to describe only the currently implemented non-interactive workflow.
- Leave the state document vague about the missing interactive behavior.
- Treat the execution spec as the source of truth instead of the canonical feature context.

**Impact**

- The feature context can remain honest about both the intended interactive behavior and the still-missing implementation.
- Context verification has an explicit rationale for the current absence of interactive generate review, minimal plan modification, and interactive decision capture.
- Implementation work can proceed without hiding the gap or weakening the canonical spec.

### Decision: implement interactive generate review as a thin layer over the existing planning and verification pipeline

Timestamp: 2026-04-21T15:05:00-04:00

**Context**

- `001-interactive-generate-plan-review` required `generate` to expose plan review, diffs, approval, minimal modification, risk gating, and richer result payloads.
- The repository already had a working non-interactive generate engine with deterministic planning, validation, execution, and verification.
- Interactive plan modification needed to affect actual execution rather than only the displayed preview.

**Decision**

- Implement interactive generate review as a dedicated review layer that sits on top of the existing generate planner and validator.
- Reuse the current plan, validation, and verification pipeline for both previewed and approved plans.
- Make the reviewed action list authoritative at execution time so excluded files or actions are not still written by the underlying strategy.

**Reasoning**

- A thin review layer preserves the existing deterministic generate architecture and avoids creating a second planning system.
- Reusing the current validator and verification runner keeps safety checks aligned between interactive and non-interactive modes.
- Executing only the approved action subset is required for interactive modification to be trustworthy instead of cosmetic.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Fork the generate engine into separate interactive and non-interactive execution paths.
- Limit interactive mode to approve or reject only and skip minimal plan modification.
- Keep strategy-level execution unchanged and treat interactive exclusions as preview-only.

**Impact**

- `foundry generate --interactive` now shows summary, detail, and unified diffs before mutation, supports approve or reject, supports minimal plan filtering, records user decisions, and enforces high-risk confirmation.
- Interactive execution now honors filtered plans at apply time while preserving the existing non-interactive workflow.
- Canonical feature state can now track `002-generate-skill-integration` and preview-strategy expansion as follow-on work instead of pending core interactive implementation.

### Decision: add repository-local generate policy evaluation as an explicit pre-execution gate

Timestamp: 2026-04-23T23:12:43-04:00

**Context**

- `005-generate-policies` required generate plans to become policy-aware without replacing the existing planner, validator, interactive review layer, or persisted plan history contract.
- The existing generate engine already had deterministic plan validation, safety routing, interactive review, and append-only persisted plan records that could carry the new policy state.
- The first policy step needed to stay machine-enforced, repository-local, and deterministic instead of introducing prose interpretation or a large policy DSL.

**Decision**

- Add `.foundry/policies/generate.json` as the repository-local V1 generate policy file and evaluate it through one dedicated generate policy engine after plan validation.
- Keep V1 policy matching explicit and small: action type, path globbing, mode, risk level, feature or module name when available, and graph node type when available.
- Make V1 blocking policy results overrideable only through an explicit CLI flag or explicit interactive confirmation, and persist the full evaluated policy result with each terminal generate plan record.

**Reasoning**

- A single policy engine preserves determinism and avoids scattering implicit policy checks across unrelated generate code paths.
- Repository-local policy storage keeps governance close to the project state that generate is mutating and avoids introducing remote dependencies or organization-wide infrastructure prematurely.
- Explicit override visibility protects user trust by making policy bypass a conscious, persisted decision instead of a hidden implementation detail.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Add lightweight policy checks directly inside `GenerateEngine`, `PlanValidator`, and the interactive reviewer instead of introducing a dedicated policy engine.
- Delay policy persistence until a future plan-history revision and only expose policy results in immediate command output.
- Introduce non-overrideable policy outcomes in V1.

**Impact**

- `foundry generate` now supports deterministic repository-local policy evaluation, `--policy-check`, visible override reporting, and interactive policy confirmation without changing the existing planning foundation.
- Human output, JSON payloads, history records, and persisted plan records now all carry policy status and override metadata consistently.
- Future policy work can extend rule kinds or override semantics on top of a stable persisted result shape instead of retrofitting policy state later.

### Decision: add conservative persisted-plan undo with explicit rollback inputs and destructive-confirmation gating

Timestamp: 2026-04-23T12:29:29-04:00

**Context**

- The `003.002-plan-undo` execution spec required a first undo layer for persisted generate plans, but it explicitly rejected pretending that Foundry could perform perfect rollback for every action type.
- Existing persisted plan records already carried executable plan data and executed-action summaries, but they did not preserve the pre-change file contents needed to restore updated or deleted files safely.
- Create-file rollback is destructive because the reversal deletes files, and update/delete rollback is only trustworthy when the prior contents were captured explicitly.

**Decision**

- Add `plan:undo <plan_id>` as an explicit persisted-plan rollback surface with `--dry-run` preview support and `--yes` confirmation gating for destructive generated-file deletion.
- Extend successful live plan records to persist the minimal pre-change file snapshots needed for conservative V1 undo under the repository-local `.foundry/plans/` artifact contract.
- Limit V1 undo to deterministic file-action rollback only: delete newly created generated files when the stored pre-change snapshot proves the path was absent, restore updated files only when prior contents were persisted, and restore deleted files only when prior contents were persisted.
- Report irreversible actions, unsafe current-state skips, and partial outcomes explicitly instead of silently guessing rollback behavior.

**Reasoning**

- Persisting only the minimal rollback inputs needed for supported file actions keeps the plan artifact contract local and deterministic without introducing full repository snapshots or hidden history stores.
- Requiring explicit confirmation before deleting generated files makes undo trustworthy for humans and agents, especially in non-interactive or JSON-driven flows.
- Treating missing rollback data and current-state drift as explicit irreversible or skipped cases preserves user trust better than attempting best guesses that might overwrite manual edits.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Add git-based rollback as the primary undo mechanism in this step.
- Reconstruct previous file contents heuristically from plan metadata or current repository state.
- Allow destructive create-file reversal by default without requiring an explicit confirmation step.

**Impact**

- Foundry now has a first-class persisted-plan undo surface that is honest about what V1 can and cannot reverse.
- Successful generate runs carry enough local rollback data for supported update and delete reversals without changing the broader history subsystem.
- Future undo work can extend this contract deliberately while preserving the current conservative guarantee.

### Decision: upgrade persisted-plan undo to structured snapshot-and-patch rollback with integrity checks

Timestamp: 2026-04-23T16:59:57-04:00

**Context**

- `004-plan-snapshot-and-patch-based-undo` required persisted generate plans to carry stronger rollback data than the first conservative undo step from `003.002`.
- The existing undo contract could restore files from stored pre-change snapshots, but it did not expose a real patch-based path, store post-change integrity signals, or distinguish clearly between snapshot-backed and patch-backed reversal.
- The new step still prohibited Git dependence and full version-control semantics, so the stronger rollback model had to remain repository-local and deterministic.

**Decision**

- Extend successful live persisted plan records to store structured rollback payloads with `file_snapshots_before`, `file_snapshots_after`, unified-diff `patches`, and before/after integrity hashes.
- Teach `plan:undo` to prefer patch-backed restoration for updated or deleted files when a valid stored patch is available, and to fall back to snapshot-backed restoration when patch data is unavailable but trusted snapshots exist.
- Validate stored post-change hashes against the current filesystem before applying rollback, emit explicit `integrity_warnings`, and refuse or skip affected actions instead of guessing when integrity has drifted.
- Extend undo output with deterministic rollback-specific fields including `rollback_mode`, `reversible`, `files_recovered`, `files_unrecoverable`, and `confidence_level`.

**Reasoning**

- Persisting both snapshots and unified diffs keeps rollback data self-contained and deterministic while letting undo scale beyond pure snapshot restore for common update/delete paths.
- Hash-based integrity checks make rollback safer by turning hidden divergence into explicit warnings and skips rather than silent overwrite behavior.
- Keeping patch use inside the existing persisted-plan undo surface avoids creating a second rollback subsystem or drifting away from the append-only `.foundry/plans/` contract.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Keep snapshot-only rollback and treat `004` as documentation-only tightening.
- Persist only patches and remove stored snapshots entirely.
- Require Git for integrity and rollback instead of embedding rollback payloads in plan artifacts.

**Impact**

- Persisted generate plans now carry enough structured rollback data to support both snapshot-backed and patch-backed undo deterministically.
- Undo output is more explicit about rollback fidelity, integrity mismatches, and actual recovered versus unrecoverable files.
- Future rollback work can build on the same artifact contract without backtracking on the no-guessing rule.

### Decision: implement explicit persisted-plan replay on top of the existing generate execution path

Timestamp: 2026-04-23T10:11:10-04:00

**Context**

- `003.001-plan-replay` required persisted generate plans to become executable inputs rather than inspection-only artifacts.
- The repository already persisted canonical plan records under `.foundry/plans/`, but replay still needed a safe command surface, drift handling, and deterministic execution based on stored plan data.
- Replay needed to reuse existing generate validation, git safety, execution ordering, and verification behavior without silently creating a fresh plan behind the user’s back.

**Decision**

- Add `plan:replay <plan_id>` as an explicit replay command over persisted generate plan artifacts.
- Reconstruct replay execution from the stored approved final plan when present and otherwise the stored original plan, together with persisted intent metadata needed for deterministic validation and execution.
- Support adaptive replay by default, strict replay failure with `--strict`, and validation-only dry runs with `--dry-run`.
- Surface drift explicitly in both success and strict-failure paths instead of silently adapting the stored artifact itself.

**Reasoning**

- Reusing the stored plan artifact keeps replay truthful to the persisted generate result and avoids quietly re-planning from changed system state.
- Keeping replay on the existing generate execution path preserves deterministic file ordering, validator behavior, git safety checks, and verification semantics.
- Explicit drift reporting lets adaptive replay remain useful while still giving strict replay a clear contract for reproducibility-sensitive use cases.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Regenerate a fresh plan from the stored intent and call that replay.
- Block replay entirely unless current source hashes and filesystem state match exactly.
- Create a second replay-only executor disconnected from the existing generate engine helpers.

**Impact**

- Persisted plans are now reusable operational inputs rather than one-time history artifacts.
- Developers and agents can choose between adaptive replay, strict replay, and dry-run replay with deterministic JSON output and explicit drift visibility.
- The replay foundation now exists for future undo and richer policy layers without weakening the stored-plan contract.

### Decision: make interactive generate smoke coverage use a valid mode-bearing invocation

Timestamp: 2026-04-22T00:15:00-04:00

**Context**

- Interactive generate behavior was already implemented and covered by integration tests, but the older `001-interactive-generate-plan-review` execution spec still showed a mode-less `foundry generate "<intent>" --interactive` command shape.
- The actual CLI contract requires `--mode=new|modify|repair`, so a mode-less smoke example was misleading even though the working tests already used valid invocations.
- `001.001-valid-interactive-generate-smoke-invocation` required one explicit harmless smoke-style path that proves review logic is reached rather than failing in argument validation.

**Decision**

- Keep interactive generate smoke coverage on the existing CLI integration path.
- Add one explicit non-destructive smoke-style integration test that uses `foundry generate ... --mode=new --interactive --json`, reaches review logic, records rejection, and performs no writes.
- Update the older execution-spec example so repository documentation no longer suggests a mode-less interactive invocation.

**Reasoning**

- The implementation gap was primarily contract drift and the absence of one named smoke-style assertion, not missing core interactive behavior.
- Reusing the existing integration harness keeps the change narrow and deterministic.
- A rejection path is the safest way to prove interactive entry and decision handling without depending on risky filesystem mutation.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Add a second bespoke smoke harness outside the existing generate integration tests.
- Leave the older execution-spec example unchanged because execution specs are non-authoritative after implementation.
- Use an approval path that writes files as the smoke check.

**Impact**

- The repository now has truthful, explicit smoke coverage for the valid interactive generate entry path.
- Future regressions that accidentally reintroduce early `GENERATE_MODE_REQUIRED` failures into the smoke path are easier to catch.
- Generate-engine docs and implementation coverage now align on the required `--mode` contract for interactive usage.

### Decision: expose deterministic generate safety-routing guidance as payload-level skill contract data

Timestamp: 2026-04-22T10:20:00-04:00

**Context**

- `002-generate-skill-integration` required agents to choose deterministically between the fast non-interactive generate path and interactive review based on intent, risk, and context.
- The repository does not have an in-process skill runtime that can execute a named Codex skill inside the framework itself.
- The generate engine already computes plan confidence, plan structure, and interactive risk signals that can drive the routing decision without changing core generation behavior.

**Decision**

- Implement `generate-with-safety-routing` as a deterministic payload contract emitted by `foundry generate` rather than as a framework-internal skill runner.
- Add a dedicated safety router that inspects explicit interactive intent, CI context, plan confidence, and generate-plan risk to recommend either `interactive` or `non_interactive`.
- Persist the routing recommendation in generate JSON and history payloads, and surface the recommended mode in default human output.

**Reasoning**

- Emitting the routing contract in payload data keeps the framework focused on deterministic planning and execution while still giving agents a stable integration point.
- Reusing existing plan confidence and risk analysis avoids duplicating generate logic or creating a second planning pass purely for routing.
- Including the same recommendation in both human and machine-readable output keeps developers and agents aligned on why a route was chosen.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Build a framework-owned skill runtime that executes named agent skills directly.
- Route only on risk level and ignore plan confidence or CI context.
- Keep routing knowledge external to the framework and require every agent integration to reimplement it independently.

**Impact**

- Agents can consume `safety_routing` deterministically to decide when to stay on the fast path and when to escalate to interactive review.
- Generate output remains backward compatible while becoming more useful for automation-aware tooling.
- Future CLI work can add `--no-interactive` as an explicit override without changing the routing contract shape.

### Decision: persist terminal generate runs as repository-local plan artifacts while retaining the broader history surface

Timestamp: 2026-04-23T00:40:00-04:00

**Context**

- The `003-plan-persistence-and-history` execution spec required every terminal generate run to become a first-class persisted artifact with enough canonical data for later inspection, replay, and undo work.
- The repository already had `history` support backed by `app/.foundry/build/history`, but that surface was shared across build, quality, observability, and generate records and stored a narrower summary-oriented generate payload.
- The new contract needed stable plan ids, append-only repository-local storage, and dedicated inspection commands without regressing the existing generate workflow or broader history features.

**Decision**

- Add a dedicated persisted plan store under `.foundry/plans/` for terminal generate runs.
- Keep plan records append-only and machine-readable with explicit storage versioning, UUID plan ids, filesystem-safe timestamps, canonical context and plan data, and terminal status semantics (`success`, `failed`, `aborted`).
- Add `plan:list` and `plan:show <plan_id>` as the dedicated inspection surface for persisted generate plan history.
- Retain the older `history --kind=generate` surface for compatibility and broader build/observability-style history, rather than replacing it in this step.

**Reasoning**

- A dedicated plan store keeps the replay/undo foundation explicit instead of overloading the broader shared history surface with plan-specific semantics.
- Persisting canonical plan data at terminal states makes rejected interactive sessions and failed generate attempts inspectable without pretending they succeeded.
- Keeping the existing `history` surface avoids unnecessary churn in unrelated observability and compatibility workflows while the new plan contract stabilizes.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Extend `app/.foundry/build/history` in place and skip a dedicated `.foundry/plans/` contract.
- Persist only successful generate runs and treat failures or interactive rejections as logs-only events.
- Add replay or undo execution in the same step instead of separating persistence from later action-taking commands.

**Impact**

- Generate-engine now has a repository-local, append-only plan history contract suitable for later replay, undo, and audit work.
- Developers and agents can inspect terminal generate runs deterministically by plan id through `plan:list` and `plan:show`.
- Existing history-oriented workflows remain intact while generate gains a more purpose-built persisted artifact surface.

### Decision: implement multi-step generate workflows as an ordered wrapper over the existing single-step engine

Timestamp: 2026-04-24T11:15:00-04:00

**Context**

- `006-multi-step-generate` required generate to execute multiple coordinated steps as one deterministic workflow without inventing a separate planning DSL or bypassing the existing safety pipeline.
- The repository already had one mature single-step generate engine covering planning, validation, policy checks, interactive review, verification, history persistence, and per-plan rollback artifacts.
- Workflow steps needed shared context, explicit dependency ordering, clear per-step visibility, and fail-fast behavior that leaves earlier successful work inspectable instead of silently hiding it.

**Decision**

- Implement V1 multi-step generate as a repository-local JSON workflow file loaded through `foundry generate --workflow=<file> [--multi-step]`.
- Resolve per-step `intent`, `description`, `target`, and `packs` fields through deterministic `{{shared.*}}` and `{{steps.<id>.*}}` placeholder expansion over immutable initial shared context plus explicit step-output extensions.
- Execute workflow steps sequentially by reusing the existing single-step `GenerateEngine` path for each step, persist the underlying per-step plan records as usual, and persist one parent workflow plan record that groups the ordered workflow result.
- Keep V1 workflow mode conservative by rejecting top-level `--explain` and `--git-commit` until grouped semantics are specified explicitly.

**Reasoning**

- Wrapping the existing single-step engine preserves deterministic planning, validation, policy, and review behavior without creating a second generate subsystem.
- Placeholder-based shared context is expressive enough for V1 workflows while staying explicit, serializable, and easy to validate.
- Persisting the underlying step records preserves real rollback handles for partial-success workflows, while the parent workflow record makes the grouped run itself inspectable.
- Deferring grouped explain and git-commit behavior avoids ambiguous multi-step output and commit semantics in this bounded step.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Merge all workflow steps into one synthetic `GenerationPlan`.
- Build a dedicated workflow-only planner and executor separate from the existing generate engine.
- Skip parent workflow persistence and rely only on per-step plan records.
- Support top-level workflow `--explain` and `--git-commit` immediately.

**Impact**

- Foundry now supports deterministic ordered multi-step generate workflows with explicit dependency checks, shared context interpolation, per-step visibility, and fail-fast rollback guidance.
- Workflow mode reuses the existing generate safety pipeline and keeps successful earlier steps inspectable even when a later step fails.
- Future replay, undo, explain, and commit semantics for grouped workflow runs can now build on a real parent workflow record instead of retrofitting grouped state later.

### Decision: enforce a canonical persisted workflow-record contract for grouped generate runs

Timestamp: 2026-04-24T14:20:00-04:00

**Context**

- `007-workflow-record-contracts` required the earlier multi-step generate workflow implementation to stop persisting ad hoc parent workflow records and to define explicit parent-child linkage between grouped workflow runs and the underlying per-step generate records.
- The repository already persisted one parent workflow record plus one normal generate plan record per step, but the parent payload shape, step statuses, and linkage metadata were not yet strict enough for deterministic inspection or validation.
- The existing `.foundry/plans/` plan store and `plan:list` / `plan:show` surfaces were already the narrowest stable place to enforce grouped record integrity without inventing a second persistence or verification subsystem.

**Decision**

- Persist workflow parent records with a canonical `foundry.generate.workflow_record.v1` contract that carries deterministic workflow ids, repository-relative source paths, ordered step summaries, final shared context, compact result data, and rollback guidance.
- Keep workflow child records as ordinary persisted generate plan records, but add explicit `metadata.workflow` linkage (`workflow_id`, `step_id`, `step_index`, `is_workflow_step`) whenever a step record is produced inside a grouped workflow run.
- Treat plan-store loading and inspection as integrity gates for grouped records by validating canonical parent shape, ordered step indexes, required record ids, parent-child linkage, and workflow result/status consistency before records are listed or shown.

**Reasoning**

- Reusing the existing persisted plan store keeps grouped workflow history in one place and avoids a parallel workflow-history subsystem that would drift from replay, undo, and inspect behavior.
- Canonical parent records plus linked child records preserve both grouped visibility and step-level rollback handles without hiding partial-success details.
- Failing inspection on malformed or orphaned grouped records is safer than silently accepting broken history artifacts that could mislead later replay, undo, or agent inspection work.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Keep the ad hoc parent workflow payload and rely on documentation alone instead of enforcing a strict canonical contract.
- Collapse grouped workflows into a single synthetic step record and remove per-step persisted plan artifacts.
- Add a dedicated workflow-history validator or second storage path outside the existing `.foundry/plans/` store.

**Impact**

- `foundry generate --workflow=...` now persists parent workflow records with an explicit canonical contract and step records with explicit linkage metadata.
- `plan:list` and `plan:show` can now distinguish standalone generate records, workflow parents, and workflow child records clearly in both JSON and text output.
- Broken grouped workflow history now fails inspection deterministically instead of remaining latent repository-local debt.

### Decision: implement generate templates as a deterministic registry and route them through the existing single-step and workflow engine paths

Timestamp: 2026-04-24T16:05:00-04:00

**Context**

- `008-generate-templates-and-recipes` required reusable parameterized generate templates without introducing a second planning pipeline or weakening the existing validation, policy, workflow, persistence, and inspection contracts.
- The repository already had two stable execution seams: direct single-step generate execution and multi-step workflow execution backed by repository-local workflow definitions.
- Template support needed to remain deterministic, repository-local, and inspectable, including clear provenance in persisted plan artifacts.

**Decision**

- Add `.foundry/templates/*.json` as the V1 repository-local generate template registry with canonical schema `foundry.generate.template.v1`.
- Resolve declared `{{parameters.*}}` placeholders deterministically into either a single-step generate definition or an in-memory workflow definition.
- Route resolved single templates through the existing `runSingle()` path and resolved workflow templates through the existing workflow execution path, while persisting explicit `metadata.template` provenance on standalone generate records and workflow parent/child records.

**Reasoning**

- Reusing the existing execution seams preserves the current planner, validator, policy engine, interactive review, verification loop, and persisted plan record behavior instead of creating a parallel template-specific execution stack.
- A repository-local JSON registry keeps template discovery deterministic and easy to inspect, while declared parameter types and defaults make resolution predictable for both humans and agents.
- Persisting template provenance alongside plan records makes template-driven execution auditable and keeps `generate`, `plan:list`, and `plan:show` aligned.

**Alternatives Considered**

- Add template execution as a separate planning DSL and executor.
- Store templates in framework-owned global locations or remote registries in V1.
- Resolve templates into ad hoc shell arguments or temporary workflow files instead of in-memory definitions.

**Impact**

- `foundry generate --template=<template_id> [--param <name=value>]` now supports deterministic repository-local recipes for both single-step and workflow-backed generation.
- Invalid template schemas, unknown or missing parameters, type mismatches, and unresolved parameter references now fail explicitly before any generate execution occurs.
- Persisted generate and workflow records now expose template id, template file path, generate type, and resolved parameters as first-class inspection metadata.
