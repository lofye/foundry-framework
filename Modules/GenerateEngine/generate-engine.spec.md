# Feature Spec: generate-engine

## Purpose

- Provide a deterministic explain-driven generation surface for evolving Foundry applications safely.
- Keep generation explicit, reviewable, and verifiable whether the workflow is automatic or interactive.

## Goals

- Plan generation work from the current explain-derived system state.
- Preserve the existing non-interactive generate workflow for fast deterministic changes.
- Add an interactive review-and-approval layer for riskier generate flows without duplicating core planning or verification logic.
- Persist terminal generate runs as first-class repository-local plan artifacts that later inspection, replay, and undo work can consume.
- Keep machine-readable and human-readable outputs aligned so agents and developers can inspect the same plan.

## Non-Goals

- Do not introduce a web UI or terminal UI panel system for generate review.
- Do not replace the existing `GenerateEngine`, `GenerationPlan`, `PlanValidator`, or `VerificationRunner` with a second planning pipeline.
- Do not weaken non-interactive generate for users who do not opt into interactive review.

## Constraints

- Generate behavior must remain deterministic for the same input and project state.
- Interactive review must not mutate files before explicit approval.
- Interactive review must reuse the existing plan, validation, and verification primitives instead of reimplementing them.
- Persisted generate plan history must be repository-local, append-only, machine-readable, and complete enough for later inspection and reuse.
- Risky mutations must surface explicit warnings and stronger confirmation requirements.
- JSON output must remain trustworthy for automation consumers.

## Expected Behavior

- `foundry generate` plans work from the current explain-derived model using explicit `new`, `modify`, and `repair` modes plus deterministic target resolution.
- The existing non-interactive generate workflow continues to support dry runs, confidence reporting, git safety checks, pack requirement handling, architectural snapshots and diffs, and post-apply verification.
- Generate JSON output exposes a deterministic `safety_routing` recommendation that agent skills can use to choose between the fast non-interactive path and interactive review.
- Interactive generate mode renders a plan summary, per-action detail, and file diffs before any file mutation occurs.
- Interactive generate mode supports approve, reject, and minimal plan modification flows by excluding actions or files, then revalidates the modified plan before execution.
- Interactive generate mode classifies risk and requires stronger confirmations for deletions, schema changes, and contract-affecting work.
- Interactive generate output includes the original plan, modified plan when applicable, recorded user decisions, executed actions, and verification results in both human and JSON-friendly forms.
- Generate optionally loads `.foundry/policies/generate.json`, evaluates deterministic repository-local policy rules against the validated plan before execution, and surfaces policy status, matched rules, warnings, violations, and override state in both human and JSON output.
- `foundry generate --policy-check` evaluates plan policy without mutating feature files, while `--allow-policy-violations` remains an explicit override that must stay visible in output and persisted plan history.
- V1 generate policy violations remain overrideable only through an explicit CLI override or explicit interactive confirmation, and policy results are persisted alongside terminal generate plan records.
- `foundry generate --workflow=<file> [--multi-step]` now executes repository-local JSON workflow definitions as ordered multi-step generate runs with explicit dependencies, deterministic shared-context placeholder resolution, per-step input/output/status reporting, and fail-fast rollback guidance.
- `foundry generate --template=<template_id> [--param <name=value>]` now loads repository-local JSON templates from `.foundry/templates/*.json`, validates declared parameter types and defaults deterministically, resolves `{{parameters.*}}` placeholders into either a single generate definition or a workflow definition, and then executes through the existing single-step or workflow engine path.
- Workflow steps reuse the existing single-step generate planner, validator, policy checks, interactive review, and persisted plan-record pipeline instead of creating a separate execution engine.
- Workflow parent plan records now persist a canonical `foundry.generate.workflow_record.v1` contract with deterministic workflow IDs, ordered step summaries, final shared context, compact result data, and explicit rollback guidance, while child step records persist normal generate records with explicit workflow linkage metadata.
- Every terminal generate run persists a canonical plan record under `.foundry/plans/` with plan identity, intent, targets, generation context, original/final plan data, execution outcome, verification data, and explicit storage version metadata.
- Persisted generate plan records use UUID plan ids and filesystem-safe timestamped filenames.
- Successful runs, failed runs, and interactive rejections all persist terminal plan artifacts with truthful status semantics instead of leaving failures to logs only.
- `plan:list` provides a deterministic list of persisted generate plan summaries and `plan:show <plan_id>` resolves one canonical persisted record by plan id.
- `plan:replay <plan_id>` reuses a persisted generate plan artifact by selecting the approved final plan when present and otherwise the original executable plan, then revalidates it before execution.
- `plan:undo <plan_id>` performs deterministic rollback from persisted plan artifacts, supports dry-run preview, requires explicit confirmation before deleting generated files, and uses structured snapshot or patch rollback data instead of guesswork.
- Replay supports adaptive drift-aware execution by default, strict replay failure with `--strict`, and dry-run validation with `--dry-run`.
- Persisted plan records retain the execution metadata needed to reconstruct replay intent deterministically without regenerating a fresh plan silently, and successful live runs now persist structured rollback inputs including before/after snapshots, unified diffs, and integrity hashes for undo.
- The dedicated persisted plan surface coexists with the broader shared `history` surface instead of replacing it in this step.
- The older `history --kind=generate` surface remains available for compatibility and broader build and observability style history while persisted plans stabilize as a dedicated contract.
- Repository-owned integration coverage includes a valid non-destructive interactive smoke path that uses the required `--mode`, reaches review logic, and can reject without filesystem mutation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `foundry generate` remains deterministic and continues to support the existing non-interactive workflow.
- Non-interactive generate continues to expose dry-run planning, confidence data, git safeguards, pack resolution, snapshots and diffs, and verification results.
- Generate emits a deterministic safety-routing recommendation that prefers non-interactive execution for low-risk additive work and interactive review for risky or uncertain plans.
- `foundry generate --interactive` and `foundry generate -i` present full plan visibility before execution, including summary, detail, and diff output for file changes.
- Interactive generate supports approve, reject, and minimal plan modification without mutating files before approval.
- Interactive generate surfaces risk classification in the plan summary and enforces additional confirmation for risky work.
- Interactive generate reuses the existing plan, validator, and verification pipeline instead of duplicating core logic.
- Interactive generate emits stable human and JSON output that records plan state, decisions, execution, and verification.
- Generate emits stable human and JSON policy results covering whether a repository policy was loaded, the evaluated status, matched rules, surfaced warnings or violations, and whether an explicit override was used.
- `foundry generate --policy-check` evaluates the plan and repository policy without executing file mutations, and policy-denied plans do not execute silently without an explicit override.
- `foundry generate --workflow=<file> [--multi-step]` executes ordered workflow steps sequentially, resolves explicit dependencies, merges deterministic shared-context outputs between steps, and reports each step’s input, output, and status in CLI and JSON output.
- `foundry generate --template=<template_id> [--param <name=value>]` loads repository-local templates deterministically, rejects invalid template schemas or parameter values clearly, and exposes template id plus resolved parameters in both immediate generate output and persisted plan inspection.
- Workflow runs fail fast on the first failing step, return the failed step id and rollback guidance explicitly, and keep earlier successful steps visible instead of collapsing them into silent partial success.
- Persisted workflow parent records expose deterministic canonical workflow fields, child step linkage metadata, and inspection-friendly ordered step summaries, and invalid or orphaned workflow records fail persisted-plan inspection instead of being ignored.
- Terminal generate runs persist append-only plan artifacts under `.foundry/plans/` with an explicit storage version and canonical plan/execution metadata.
- Persisted generate plan artifacts use UUID plan ids, filesystem-safe timestamped paths, and truthful terminal status values for success, failure, and abort outcomes.
- `plan:list` and `plan:show <plan_id>` expose deterministic inspection of persisted generate plan history.
- `plan:replay <plan_id>` replays persisted generate plans explicitly, fails clearly when replayable plan data is missing, and uses the stored plan artifact as the execution basis instead of silently regenerating a new plan.
- `plan:undo <plan_id>` previews or applies snapshot- or patch-backed rollback explicitly, reports reversible versus irreversible actions honestly, and refuses destructive file deletions until the user confirms with `--yes`.
- Replay exposes adaptive, strict, and dry-run modes with explicit `drift_detected`, `drift_summary`, `actions_executed`, and `verification` output.
- Undo exposes deterministic `rollback_mode`, `reversible`, `files_recovered`, `files_unrecoverable`, `integrity_warnings`, `confidence_level`, `status`, `reversible_actions`, `reversed_actions`, `irreversible_actions`, `skipped_actions`, and `warnings` output.
- The older `history --kind=generate` inspection surface remains available alongside persisted plan records for broader compatibility-oriented history workflows.
- Interactive generate coverage includes an explicit valid smoke invocation that reaches review behavior without failing early in argument validation.
- Adding interactive review does not regress the default non-interactive workflow.

## Assumptions

- The current explain-derived planning pipeline remains the canonical foundation for both non-interactive and interactive generate flows.
- The current explain-derived planning pipeline remains the canonical foundation for both direct generate execution and deterministic agent-side safety routing.
