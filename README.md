# Foundry Framework

Foundry is a production-minded, explicit, deterministic, LLM-first PHP framework for building feature-local web apps.
Visit [FoundryFramework.org](https://foundryframework.org) for extensive documentation.

Core Foundry remains MIT-licensed and fully usable without restriction.
Explain, generate, diagnostics, trace analysis, and graph diffing remain available without a license.
The monetization system is opt-in, local-first, and isolated from core compile, inspect, verify, scaffold, and runtime flows.

It is optimized for:
- explicit contracts
- deterministic generation
- machine-readable inspection
- small safe edit surfaces
- strong verification and testing

Foundry now includes a semantic compiler core:
- source files are compiled into a canonical application graph
- runtime indexes are projections of that graph
- verification and impact analysis operate over compiled graph state

## Start Here

New to Foundry?

- Scaffold an app with `foundry new my-foundry-app --starter=standard --json`
- Use `foundry help inspect` and `foundry help verify` to discover the safest first commands
- Read `docs/quick-tour.md` and `docs/example-applications.md`
- Start with `examples/hello-world`

## Licensing

Foundry is fully usable without a license.
Licenses are retained for future identity and service access, and licensing remains local-first:

- core compile, inspect, verify, scaffold, runtime, and prompt flows remain available without a license
- `doctor --deep`, `explain`, `diff`, `trace`, and `generate "<intent>"` remain available without a license
- licensing is stored locally at `~/.foundry/license.json` by default and may also be supplied through `FOUNDRY_LICENSE_KEY`
- license state is intended for future identity and service participation such as marketplace access
- `generate` works in deterministic mode without any provider and otherwise uses whatever local/remote provider you configure in `config/ai.php`
- `explain` derives architecture explanations from the compiled graph, projections, diagnostics, and docs metadata, not from an LLM
- usage tracking stays off unless you explicitly opt in with `FOUNDRY_USAGE_TRACKING=1`
- no background network calls are performed
- optional remote validation runs only during `license activate` when `FOUNDRY_LICENSE_VALIDATION_URL` is configured

Manage licensing locally:

```bash
foundry license activate --key=YOUR_KEY
foundry license status --json
foundry license deactivate --json
foundry features --json
```

Core commands do not depend on license state.

## Packs and Hosted Registry

Foundry supports deterministic local packs and an optional read-only hosted registry.

- pack sources must include a `foundry.json` manifest with `name`, `version`, `description`, `entry`, `capabilities`, `checksum`, and `signature`
- installed files are copied into `.foundry/packs/{vendor}/{pack}/{version}/` and remain immutable once installed
- active versions are tracked in `.foundry/packs/installed.json`
- graph boot loads only active packs, with deterministic ordering by pack name then active version
- activation fails explicitly when a pack introduces command collisions, schema collisions, or duplicate graph node ids
- hosted discovery reads a public JSON index from `FOUNDRY_PACK_REGISTRY_URL` or `https://foundryframework.org/packs`
- hosted rows include `download_url`, `checksum`, `signature`, and `verified`
- hosted downloads are metadata-only and must provide HTTPS `.zip` archives with `foundry.json` and `src/` at the root; installation still reuses the same local pack pipeline after extraction

Manage packs with:

```bash
foundry pack search blog --json
foundry pack install foundry/blog --json
foundry pack install foundry/blog@1.2.0 --json
foundry pack install ../packs/acme-blog --json
foundry pack list --json
foundry pack info acme/blog --json
foundry pack remove acme/blog --json
foundry inspect packs --json
```

The hosted registry remains optional. If it is unavailable, local pack installs still work unchanged. Pack entry classes must implement `Foundry\Packs\PackServiceProvider` and register behavior explicitly through `Foundry\Packs\PackContext`.

## Runtime and Language
- PHP `^8.4`
- Composer-based

In installed Foundry apps, use the project-local `foundry` launcher from the app root. If your shell does not resolve current-directory executables, use `./foundry ...`. In this framework repository, continue to use `php bin/foundry ...`.

## Install And First Run (Packagist)
```bash
composer require lofye/foundry-framework
foundry new my-foundry-app --starter=standard --json
cd my-foundry-app
composer install

foundry help inspect
foundry help verify
foundry compile graph --json
foundry inspect graph --json
foundry inspect pipeline --json
foundry doctor --json
foundry verify graph --json
foundry verify pipeline --json
foundry verify contracts --json
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 public/index.php
```

If you are already inside an empty project directory, scaffold into the current folder instead:

```bash
mkdir my-foundry-app
cd my-foundry-app
composer require lofye/foundry-framework
foundry new . --starter=standard --name=acme/my-foundry-app --json
composer install
```

## Upgrade Foundry in an App
```bash
composer update lofye/foundry-framework
foundry compile graph --json
foundry verify graph --json
foundry verify contracts --json
```

## Core Workflow for LLMs
If you are just learning Foundry, stop after the first-run loop above and start with `examples/hello-world`. Use this fuller edit loop once you are actively changing features.

Use this loop for every change:
1. Inspect current reality.
2. Edit the minimum feature-local files.
3. Compile graph.
4. Inspect diagnostics and impact.
5. Verify graph/contracts/rules.
6. Run tests.

Recommended command sequence:
```bash
foundry inspect feature <feature> --json
foundry inspect context <feature> --json
foundry compile graph --json
foundry inspect graph --json
foundry inspect impact --file=app/features/<feature>/feature.yaml --json
foundry verify graph --json
foundry generate context <feature> --json
foundry verify feature <feature> --json
foundry verify contracts --json
foundry verify auth --json
foundry verify cache --json
foundry verify events --json
foundry verify jobs --json
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## App Structure

Rules:
- `app/features/*` is source-of-truth behavior.
- `app/.foundry/build/*` is canonical compiled output.
- `.foundry/packs/installed.json` is explicit pack activation state when local packs are in use.
- `.foundry/cache/registry.json` is optional cached hosted pack registry metadata fetched from the public `/packs` endpoint.
- `app/generated/*` remains a compatibility mirror of runtime projections.
- hot-path runtime reads generated projections (no folder scanning in request path).

## Feature Contract
Each feature must define:
- manifest (`feature.yaml`)
- action implementation (`action.php` implementing `Foundry\Feature\FeatureAction`)
- input/output schemas
- context manifest
- tests declared in `feature.yaml`

Optional feature-local files:
- `queries.sql`, `permissions.yaml`, `cache.yaml`, `events.yaml`, `jobs.yaml`, `prompts.md`

## API Stability
Foundry now classifies framework surface area explicitly:
- `public_api`: safe for apps and automation to depend on
- `extension_api`: safe for extensions to implement against
- `experimental_api`: available, but still allowed to change in minor releases
- `internal_api`: implementation detail, not a supported dependency

Stable CLI commands and the API surface registry are inspectable:
```bash
foundry help --json
foundry help compile graph --json
foundry inspect api-surface --json
foundry inspect cli-surface --json
foundry inspect api-surface --php=Foundry\\Feature\\FeatureAction --json
foundry verify cli-surface --json
```

Policy details live in `docs/public-api-policy.md` and are also emitted into generated docs as `docs/generated/api-surface.md` and `docs/generated/cli-reference.md`.

## Documentation Boundary
Canonical framework docs are authored in `docs/` in this repository.
The website repo imports that authored content plus generated reference material and is the canonical renderer/publisher of public docs and version snapshots.
Framework contributors should start with `docs/contributor-portal.md` for architecture, extension, workflow, and checklist guidance.
The canonical high-level architecture overview now lives in `docs/architecture/architecture-overview.md`; the root `ARCHITECTURE.md` file is only a pointer.

Refresh framework-side generated reference source files with:

```bash
php bin/foundry generate docs --format=markdown --json
php bin/foundry generate docs --format=html --json
```

Legacy local preview only:

```bash
php scripts/build-docs.php
```

That helper remains deprecated for framework-local preview output under `public/docs`. Do not use it as the primary publishing path.

## CLI Surface
All inspection, verification, and planning commands support `--json`.
The authoritative CLI catalog is derived from `ApiSurfaceRegistry` and exposed through:

```bash
foundry help --json
foundry help inspect
foundry help verify
foundry help generate
foundry inspect cli-surface --json
foundry verify cli-surface --json
```

The examples below are representative entry points; the generated `docs/generated/cli-reference.md` remains the exhaustive source-of-truth list.

Compile:
```bash
foundry compile graph --json
foundry compile graph --feature=<feature> --json
foundry compile graph --changed-only --json
```

Architecture analysis:
```bash
foundry doctor --json
foundry doctor --strict --json
foundry doctor --feature=<feature> --json
foundry doctor --cli --json
foundry doctor --deep --json
```

Core capabilities and license services:

- Core: `compile`, `inspect`, `verify`, `doctor`, `doctor --deep`, `prompt`, `explain <target>`, `diff`, `trace [<target>]`, `generate "<intent>"`, scaffold generators, runtime commands
- License services: `license status`, `license activate`, `license deactivate`, `features`

Licensed command surface:

```bash
foundry license activate --key=YOUR_KEY
foundry license status --json
foundry license deactivate --json
foundry features --json
foundry explain publish_post --json
foundry explain publish_post --deep
foundry explain route:POST /posts --markdown
foundry explain route:POST /posts --neighbors
foundry explain pack:foundry/blog --json
foundry diff --json
foundry trace publish_post --json
foundry generate "add bookmark support" --mode=new --dry-run --json
foundry generate "add moderation notes" --mode=modify --target=publish_post --json
foundry generate "restore missing generated artifacts" --mode=repair --target=publish_post --json
foundry generate "create blog post notes" --mode=new --packs=foundry/blog --allow-pack-install --json
```

`explain` supports typed selectors such as `feature:publish_post`, `route:POST /posts`, `command:doctor`, `event:post.created`, `workflow:editorial`, `extension:core`, and `pack:foundry/blog`.
Default text output starts with `Subject` and `Summary`, then renders canonical sections such as `Responsibilities`, `Execution Flow`, `Depends On`, `Emits`, `Triggers`, `Permissions`, `Schema Interaction`, `Graph Relationships`, `Related Commands`, `Related Docs`, `Diagnostics`, and `Suggested Fixes` when present. Extra sections such as `Impact` render afterward through the assembler-owned `sectionOrder`.
`--deep` expands the same structure with detailed flow stages and expanded graph relationships instead of switching to a different format.
`--json` returns a deliberate machine-readable contract with canonical `graph`, `execution`, `guards`, `events`, `schemas`, `docs`, `impact`, `commands`, and `extensions` domains, while preserving the legacy `executionFlow`, `relationships`, `relatedCommands`, `relatedDocs`, `diagnostics`, `suggestedFixes`, `sections`, and `sectionOrder` keys for compatibility.
Extensions can enrich explain output deterministically by implementing `Foundry\Explain\Contributors\ExplainContributorInterface` and returning `Foundry\Explain\Contributors\ExplainContribution` entries that the registry merges before rendering. Contributor sections are normalized through `Foundry\Explain\ExplainSection`.

`generate` is now explain-driven and pack-aware:

- `--mode=new` scaffolds a new feature through deterministic generators selected from core and installed packs.
- `--mode=modify` applies controlled updates against an explain-resolved target and preserves extension boundaries.
- `--mode=repair` restores missing generated artifacts and reruns verification before keeping the change.
- `--packs=vendor/pack` hints pack-specific generators, and `--allow-pack-install` lets Foundry install missing packs before planning.

## Tests
Test suite includes unit and integration coverage for:
- parsing/validation/generation/verification
- CLI JSON command behavior
- HTTP feature execution pipeline
- DB query execution
- queue/event/cache/webhook/AI subsystems
- example app structure checks

Run:
```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Optional local integration targets:
- Redis queue integration tests run when `ext-redis` is loaded and Redis is reachable on `127.0.0.1:6379`.
- PostgreSQL integration tests run when `pdo_pgsql` is loaded and Postgres is reachable.
- PostgreSQL DSN/user/pass can be overridden with:
  `FOUNDRY_TEST_PG_DSN`, `FOUNDRY_TEST_PG_USER`, `FOUNDRY_TEST_PG_PASS`.
- If `postgresql@17` is keg-only on Homebrew, use:
  `/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@17/bin/psql`
  and optionally add it to `PATH`.

Coverage note:
- code coverage output requires a coverage driver (`xdebug` or `pcov`).
- if not installed, tests still run but coverage metrics are unavailable.
- when Xdebug is installed but not auto-loaded in CLI, run coverage with:
  `php -dzend_extension=/path/to/xdebug.so -d xdebug.mode=coverage vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-text`
