## Execution Policies

### Reasoning Policy

Before any non-trivial work, load:

`docs/policies/codex-reasoning-policy.md`

Requirements:

- follow the Codex reasoning policy for the current task
- use the lowest reasoning level likely to succeed reliably
- start at medium for bounded deterministic work
- use high for multi-file, core-workflow, or non-trivial debugging work
- use extra high only for architecture, hard root-cause analysis, invariant discovery, or repeated-failure investigation
- if a different reasoning level is needed, stop and start a new run at that new level

### Execution Requirements

You must load `docs/policies/codex-reasoning-policy.md` before:

- meaningful implementation
- spec revision
- context repair
- stabilization
- root-cause debugging
- architecture work

Execution rules:

- keep reasoning proportional to authority, risk, and determinism
- prefer iterative escalation over defaulting to maximum reasoning
- when specs, commands, or validation rules tightly constrain the task, follow them rather than improvising
- do not treat the reasoning policy as optional guidance

---

## Command Rule

- In Foundry app repos, prefer `foundry ...`
- If your shell does not resolve current-directory executables, use `./foundry ...`
- Prefer `--json` for inspect, verify, doctor, prompt, export, and generation commands when an agent is consuming the output

## Source Of Truth

- Treat `app/features/*` as source-of-truth application behavior
- Treat `app/definitions/*` as source-of-truth definitions when that folder exists
- Treat `app/.foundry/build/*` as canonical compiled output
- Treat `.foundry/packs/installed.json` as explicit local pack activation state when packs are in use
- Treat `.foundry/cache/registry.json` as cached hosted-registry metadata when remote pack discovery is used
- Treat `.foundry/packs/*/*/*/foundry.json` as installed pack metadata, not editable app source
- Treat `app/generated/*` as generated compatibility projections
- Treat `docs/generated/*` and `docs/inspect-ui/*` as generated documentation output
- Treat `docs/policies/*` as repository execution and reasoning policy inputs
- Treat `docs/features/<feature>/<feature>.spec.md` as authoritative feature intent
- Treat `docs/features/<feature>/<feature>.md` as current state
- Treat `docs/features/<feature>/<feature>.decisions.md` as append-only decision history
- Treat code and tests as the source of truth for actual implementation and runtime behavior
- Treat `docs/features/<feature>/specs/*.md` as execution specs: planning artifacts that are non-authoritative after implementation
- Treat `docs/features/<feature>/specs/drafts/*.md` as draft execution specs: non-executable planning artifacts
- Treat `docs/features/<feature>/plans/*.md` as implementation plans: planning artifacts that are non-authoritative after implementation
- Treat `docs/features/implementation-log.md` as the completed execution-spec ledger
- Save a plan file for new active execution specs before implementation; chat-only plans are not sufficient.
- Plans describe implementation strategy only and must not expand or alter execution-spec scope.
- Execution spec IDs are ordered contracts and must stay contiguous within each feature at every hierarchy level; skipping numbers is forbidden.
- Stop instead of planning, implementing, promoting, or logging execution specs when a numeric gap exists.
- Do not hand-edit `app/generated/*`; regenerate instead
- Do not hand-edit installed pack files under `.foundry/packs/*`; reinstall or replace them from source instead

## Feature Boundary Rules (MANDATORY)

Foundry app features should be physically localized so agents can load, reason about, modify, test, and verify one feature with the smallest safe context window.

The canonical localized feature root is:

`Features/<FeatureName>/`

Recommended structure:

```text
Features/
  implementation.log
  README.md

  <FeatureName>/
    <feature>.spec.md
    <feature>.md
    <feature>.decisions.md
    specs/
    plans/
    docs/
    src/
    tests/
```

Rules:

- `Features/<FeatureName>/` is the primary LLM context boundary for app feature work.
- Feature-specific app behavior MUST live under `Features/<FeatureName>/src/` once localized feature layout is enabled.
- Feature-specific tests MUST live under `Features/<FeatureName>/tests/`.
- Feature-specific specs, plans, supporting docs, canonical spec/state files, and decision ledgers MUST live under that feature root once the localized layout is enabled.
- Shared app or framework surfaces MAY contain thin registration glue only.
- Shared surfaces MUST NOT contain feature-specific business logic, policy logic, validators, handlers, renderers, or workflows when that logic can live inside the owning feature.
- Cross-feature imports MUST be explicit, minimal, and justified by the feature contract.
- Generated output, installed pack files, cached registry data, and compiled projections MUST NOT be hand-edited to bypass feature boundaries.
- Boundary violations MUST be fixed rather than normalized away, ignored, or hidden in shared files.

Compatibility rule:

- Existing legacy paths such as `app/features/*`, `docs/features/*`, `app/generated/*`, and global tests may exist during migration.
- New feature work MUST prefer the localized `Features/<FeatureName>/` layout once the feature-boundary system is available.
- Legacy placement is allowed only when the active execution spec explicitly requires it, when migration has not yet occurred, or when the boundary validator reports it as grandfathered.

Boundary enforcement is ON by default.

Agents MUST run the feature-boundary verification command when available before claiming meaningful feature work complete:

```bash
foundry verify features --json
```

If a feature-scoped command exists, prefer it while iterating:

```bash
foundry verify features --feature=<feature-name> --json
foundry feature:map --feature=<feature-name> --json
foundry feature:inspect <feature-name> --json
```

Completion rules:

- `verify features` passing means feature boundaries are clean enough to proceed or complete.
- Boundary warnings require explicit acknowledgement and must not be silently ignored.
- Boundary failures block completion.
- Opting out of boundary enforcement is permitted only through an explicit documented project configuration and must be reported as a warning by doctor/verify.

## Safe Edit Loop

1. Load the reasoning policy and choose the correct reasoning level for the task.
2. For meaningful feature work, read the feature spec, state document, and decision ledger before editing.
3. Inspect current feature and graph reality before changing code.
4. Edit the smallest source-of-truth files that satisfy the task.
5. Compile graph and inspect diagnostics.
6. Run focused tests first while iterating.
7. Before claiming implementation completion, run the full quality gate.
8. Refresh generated docs if source-of-truth changed.

## Guard Rails

- When a bug is encountered, create a test that fails because of that bug, then modify the non-test code so that the test passes while maintaining the intent of the original code
- Never take a shortcut such as forcing a false-positive test pass
- Test coverage of lines must be kept at or above 90%
- Implementations are not complete unless the full quality gate passes

## Recommended Command Loop

Use feature-scoped inspection and verification whenever possible:

```bash
foundry explain --json
foundry inspect feature <feature> --json
foundry context doctor --feature=<feature> --json
foundry context check-alignment --feature=<feature> --json
foundry inspect context <feature> --json
foundry verify context --feature=<feature> --json
foundry compile graph --json
foundry inspect graph --json
foundry inspect pipeline --json
foundry inspect impact --file=app/features/<feature>/feature.yaml --json
foundry verify graph --json
foundry verify pipeline --json
foundry verify contracts --json
```

Completion quality gate:

```bash
php vendor/bin/phpunit
XDEBUG_MODE=coverage php vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-clover build/coverage/clover.xml
php bin/foundry verify coverage --min=90 --clover=build/coverage/clover.xml --json
```

Use `foundry context init <feature> --json` when canonical feature context files are missing.

Use `foundry context repair --feature=<feature> --json` when context verification fails and only safe normalization-style repair is appropriate.

## App Rules

- Keep changes feature-local unless the task is explicitly cross-cutting platform work
- Update feature tests and calling code together when contracts or schemas change
- Preserve explicit manifests, schemas, context files, and decision ledgers; avoid hidden behavior
- Use feature-local `prompts.md` and `context.manifest.json` when present to understand the feature before editing
- Do not silently diverge from a feature spec; if implementation must diverge, realign the code, update the spec and log the change, or record the divergence explicitly in the state document and decision ledger

## Testing And Quality Gate

- Focused tests may be used during development, but final completion must be validated against the full suite
- The full PHPUnit suite must pass before implementation is considered complete
- Coverage must run and be valid before implementation is considered complete

### Canonical quality gate:

```bash
php vendor/bin/phpunit
XDEBUG_MODE=coverage php vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-clover build/coverage/clover.xml
php bin/foundry verify coverage --min=90 --clover=build/coverage/clover.xml --json
```

- Implementation is not complete unless the quality gate passes
- Global line coverage must be ≥ 90%
- If tests fail, coverage fails, coverage output is missing/unparseable, or coverage is below threshold, do not report success
- Do not weaken assertions, delete tests, or alter outputs to hide regressions

## Context Anchoring (MANDATORY)

Foundry uses feature-level context anchoring for meaningful feature work.

Canonical feature context files:

- `docs/features/<feature-name>/<feature-name>.spec.md` = authoritative feature intent
- `docs/features/<feature-name>/<feature-name>.md` = current state
- `docs/features/<feature-name>/<feature-name>.decisions.md` = append-only decision history

Execution specs live at `docs/features/<feature-name>/specs/*.md`, but they are:

- optional
- planning artifacts only
- never authoritative once canonical feature context exists

Source-of-truth hierarchy:

1. feature spec
2. feature state
3. feature decisions
4. code and tests

Execution specs are secondary work orders and never override canonical feature context.

Feature naming rules:

- use lowercase kebab-case only
- match the filename exactly
- do not use spaces, underscores, repeated dashes, or alternate spec filenames

Spec naming rules:

- execution spec identity is `(feature, id)`
- IDs are unique within a feature, not globally across the whole project
- slugs are descriptive only and are not required to be unique
- headings must mirror the filename only
- drafts live in `docs/features/<feature>/specs/drafts/`
- active specs live in `docs/features/<feature>/specs/`
- do not rename existing IDs
- do not add metadata fields like `id`, `parent`, or `status`

## Application Feature Structure

Application features MAY colocate runtime code:

Features/<Feature>/src/

This is optional and encouraged for app-level modularity.

## Mandatory Workflow Rules

Read-before-acting rule:

- Before meaningful feature work, read the spec, state document, and decision ledger
- Do not rely on chat history as authoritative context
- Use `context doctor`, `context check-alignment`, `inspect context`, and `verify context` when context tooling is available
- Draft specs are non-executable planning artifacts.
- Agents MUST NOT implement specs from `docs/features/<feature>/specs/drafts/`.
- If asked to implement a draft spec, refuse and require promotion to the active spec path first.

Primary execution gate:

- `foundry verify context --feature=<feature> --json` is the primary machine-readable proceed/fail gate
- Meaningful work may proceed only when `verify context` passes
- `can_proceed=true` means meaningful work may proceed
- `can_proceed=false` means meaningful work is blocked and repair must happen first
- `requires_repair=true` means repair is the only valid next step before implementation
- If `verify context` is not run directly, the equivalent proceed condition is: doctor status is `ok` or `warning`, and alignment status is `ok` or `warning`

Refuse-to-proceed rule:

- Meaningful work must not proceed when `verify context` fails
- Meaningful work must not proceed when doctor status is `repairable` or `non_compliant`
- Meaningful work must not proceed when alignment status is `mismatch`

When context is non-compliant:

1. Stop.
2. Explain the non-compliance.
3. List the required corrective actions.
4. Repair or propose repair as the immediate next step.

Allowed recovery actions before implementation:

- run `foundry context init <feature> --json`
- run `foundry context repair --feature=<feature> --json`
- repair missing or malformed context files
- update the feature state document
- append a decision ledger entry
- update the feature spec and log the corresponding decision

Repair-first workflow:

- Repair is the only valid next step before implementation when context is invalid
- After meaningful implementation or planning work, update `Current State`, `Open Questions`, and `Next Steps` as needed
- After meaningful technical or architectural decisions, append a decision ledger entry
- If implementation diverges from the spec, either realign implementation, update the spec and log the change, or log and explain the divergence in the decision ledger and state document

Spec discipline:

- A feature spec must exist before meaningful implementation continues
- Each feature must have exactly one canonical spec file: `docs/<feature-name>/<feature-name>.spec.md`
- Do not create alternate spec filenames such as `.spec.v2.md`, `.phase2.spec.md`, or `-v2.spec.md`

## Ask First

Stop and ask before:

- hand-editing generated files
- changing app-wide conventions, package dependencies, or generated scaffold structure without approval
- making a behavior choice when the requested behavior is ambiguous or conflicts with the existing feature contract
