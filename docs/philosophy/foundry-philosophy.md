# The Philosophical and Architectural Foundations of Foundry

Foundry is an LLM-first web framework that competes with human-first web frameworks like Laravel

⸻

## 0. Purpose

Foundry exists to make LLM-assisted software development:
•	deterministic
•	structurally sound
•	reproducible
•	and scalable

It does this by transforming development from code generation into system compilation.

⸻

## 1. The Core Principle

The agent is not the problem. The environment is.

LLMs fail when:
•	context is implicit
•	structure is absent
•	constraints are unenforced

Foundry fixes the environment.

⸻

## 2. The Unit of Development

Traditional systems:

Code is the source of truth.

Foundry:

The system specification is the source of truth.

Code is:
•	generated
•	replaceable
•	secondary

⸻

## 3. The Canonical Application Graph

Every Foundry application is represented as a graph of:
•	entities
•	actions
•	relationships
•	flows

This graph must be:
•	explicit
•	complete
•	internally consistent

No feature may exist outside the graph.

⸻

## 4. Compilation Over Generation

All systems must follow:

Spec → Graph → Compile → Execute

Rules:
•	No direct code mutation without spec alignment
•	Compilation must validate structure before execution
•	Invalid systems must fail early

⸻

## 5. Determinism

Given the same inputs:
•	the same spec must produce the same system
•	no hidden state may influence outcomes
•	no implicit context may exist

⸻

## 6. Explicitness

All behavior must be:
•	declared
•	inspectable
•	versionable

Hidden logic is forbidden.

⸻

## 7. Structural Integrity

The system must enforce:
•	input/output contracts
•	dependency clarity
•	graph consistency

Violations must be detected before runtime.

⸻

## 8. Iteration Model

Iteration occurs through:
•	spec modification
•	recompilation
•	validation

Not through:
•	ad hoc code edits
•	prompt-based patching

⸻

## 9. Role of LLMs

LLMs are:
•	executors of intent
•	translators of specification into implementation

LLMs are not:
•	system designers
•	sources of truth

⸻

## 10. Simplicity

Simplicity is defined as:

The absence of ambiguity in system structure.

Not:
•	fewer lines of code
•	fewer files

⸻

## 11. Observability (Forward Requirement)

All systems must evolve toward:
•	full graph visibility
•	execution traceability
•	measurable behavior

⸻

## 12. Extensibility

All features must be:
•	composable
•	modular
•	graph-integrated

⸻

## 13. Anti-Patterns

The following are explicitly disallowed:
•	hidden prompt state
•	implicit architecture
•	direct code-first feature creation
•	bypassing the graph

⸻

## 14. The Goal

Foundry aims to make software development:

predictable, inspectable, and correct by construction.

⸻

## 15. Context Persistence And Reconstruction

Foundry treats durable context as part of the software.

Source code tells us what the system does now. Tests tell us what behavior is executable and protected. Specs tell us what was intended. Decision ledgers tell us why choices were made. Implementation logs tell us what was completed.

Reconstruction notes complete that loop by explaining how a spec was actually implemented.

This matters because Foundry is designed for humans and LLMs working across many sessions. Chat history is temporary. Repository context is durable.

A future agent should be able to read a module's context files, specs, decisions, reconstruction notes, implementation log, source, and tests, then resume or rebuild the module with high fidelity.

The goal is not bureaucracy. The goal is continuity: a framework that remembers not only its code, but the reasoning and implementation shape that produced it.
