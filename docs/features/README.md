# Spec Naming and Placement Policy

## Canonical identity

A spec’s canonical identity is its filename.

Format:

<id>-<slug>.md

Examples:

- 015-state-normalization-pass-and-canonical-ordering.md
- 015.001-hierarchical-spec-ids-with-padded-segments.md
- 015.002-another-child.md
- 015.002.001-grandchild.md
- 016-planner-generic-fallback-blocking-and-slug-hardening.md

## Placement rules

Specs are organized by feature.

Paths:

- `Features/<FeatureName>/specs/drafts/<id>-<slug>.md` = draft, not executable
- `Features/<FeatureName>/specs/<id>-<slug>.md` = active, executable

Examples:

- `Modules/ExecutionSpecSystem/specs/001-hierarchical-spec-ids-with-padded-segments.md`
- `Modules/ExecutionSpecSystem/specs/drafts/002-next-id-allocation.md`
- `Modules/ExecutionSpecSystem/specs/drafts/002.001-third-id-allocation.md`

The feature path provides context and execution state.
The filename provides identity.

Canonical feature context remains separate from execution specs:

- `Features/<Feature>/<feature>.spec.md` → authoritative feature intent
- `Features/<Feature>/<feature>.md` → current state
- `Features/<Feature>/<feature>.decisions.md` → append-only decision history
- `Features/<Feature>/specs/*.md` → execution specs (planning artifacts, non-authoritative after implementation)
- `Features/<Feature>/specs/drafts/*.md` → draft execution specs (non-executable planning artifacts)
- `Features/<Feature>/outcomes/*.md` → implementation plans (planning artifacts)
- `Features/implementation.log` → completed execution-spec ledger

For new active execution specs, create the corresponding implementation plan file before implementation begins. Chat-only plans are not sufficient, and plans must not expand or alter execution-spec scope.

Execution spec IDs are ordered contracts within each feature. IDs must remain contiguous at every hierarchy level, skipping numbers is forbidden, and workflows must stop (do not plan, implement, promote, or log) when a numeric gap exists.

## Heading rules

The first line inside a spec file must mirror the filename only.

Format:

`# Execution Spec: <id>-<slug>`

Example:

`# Execution Spec: 001-hierarchical-spec-ids-with-padded-segments`

Do not include the feature path in the heading.
Do not use filename-only headings such as `# 001-my-spec`.

Invalid example:

`# Execution Spec: execution-spec-system/001-hierarchical-spec-ids-with-padded-segments`

Invalid example:

`# 001-hierarchical-spec-ids-with-padded-segments`

## ID rules

- IDs are immutable once assigned.
- IDs use 3-digit segments.
- Segments are separated by `.`.
- Root specs have one segment: `015`
- Child specs append a segment: `015.001`
- Deeper descendants continue similarly: `015.002.001`
- IDs must be unique within a feature, not necessarily across the whole project.

## Hierarchy rules

Hierarchy is inferred entirely from the ID.

- Parent of `015.001` is `015`
- Parent of `015.001.023` is `015.001`
- Parent of `015.001.023.004` is `015.001.023`

The parent is obtained by removing the final segment.

## Slug rules

- Slugs use lowercase kebab-case.
- Slugs are descriptive but not authoritative.
- The numeric ID is the true immutable address.
- Slugs do not need to be unique within a feature.
- Within a feature, identity uniqueness is enforced by ID, not by slug.

## Status rules

Specs do not store status in file metadata.

Status is inferred from path:

- `Features/<FeatureName>/specs/drafts/<id>-<slug>.md` = draft, not executable
- `Features/<FeatureName>/specs/<id>-<slug>.md` = active, executable

Moving a spec from `drafts/` to the feature root promotes it from draft to executable without changing its contents.

## Draft to Spec Lifecycle

### Draft Definition

A draft spec is any spec located in:

`Features/<Feature>/specs/drafts/<id>-<slug>.md`

Drafts:
- are not executed
- may be incomplete
- may be replaced, merged, or deleted
- must still follow canonical naming rules

Standard creation path:

`foundry spec:new <feature> "<slug>"`

Standard validation path:

`foundry spec:validate`

Standard implementation-log suggestion path:

`foundry spec:log-entry <feature>/<id>-<slug>`

or:

`foundry spec:log-entry <feature> <id>`

Validation also enforces required implementation-log coverage for active specs:
- active specs must have a matching `- spec: <feature>/<id>-<slug>.md` entry in `Features/implementation.log`
- drafts remain exempt
- matching is exact rather than fuzzy

### ID Assignment Rules

- IDs must be unique within a feature.
- Draft specs must not share the same ID.
- An ID is considered reserved once a draft spec exists with that ID.
- Reusing a slug is allowed as long as the ID is different.

### Promotion to Active Spec

A draft becomes an active spec when it is moved to:

`Features/<Feature>/specs/<id>-<slug>.md`

Promotion rules:
- The filename must not change during promotion.
- The spec must be complete and implementable.
- The spec must conform to all naming and formatting rules.

### Implementation

After an active spec is implemented:

- The agent must append a correctly formatted entry to:
  `Features/implementation.log`

### Deletion and Replacement

- Draft specs may be deleted freely.
- If a draft is replaced by a more complete version:
  - the new version should reuse the same ID if appropriate
  - or use a new ID if it represents a different bounded step

### Invariant

At all times:

- Each `<feature>` must not contain more than one spec (draft or active) with the same ID.

---

## Spec ID Allocation Rules

### Purpose

Define how new spec IDs are assigned deterministically to avoid collisions and preserve append-only behavior.

---

### Root Spec Allocation

To create a new root spec within a feature:

1. Collect all root-segment IDs already in use (active and drafts).
   - Root IDs are single-segment (e.g. `001`, `002`).
   - Child specs reserve their root segment as well.
   - Example: `015.002.001` means root segment `015` is already in use.

2. Select the highest existing root ID.

3. Allocate the next ID by incrementing:

Example:
- existing: `001`, `002`, `003`
- next: `004`

---

### Child Spec Allocation

To create a child spec under a parent:

1. Identify the parent ID (e.g. `015` or `015.002`).

2. Collect all direct children:
   - children share the same prefix
   - and have exactly one additional segment

Example:
- parent: `015`
- children: `015.001`, `015.002`

3. Select the highest child segment.

4. Allocate the next segment by incrementing:

Example:
- existing: `015.001`, `015.002`
- next: `015.003`

---

### Nested Child Allocation

This rule applies recursively.

Example:

- parent: `015.002`
- existing children: `015.002.001`, `015.002.002`
- next: `015.002.003`

---

### Draft and Active Inclusion

Allocation must consider:

- active specs
- draft specs

Both reserve IDs.

---

### Collision Prevention

Before creating a new spec:

- the agent must verify that no spec (draft or active) already uses the target ID within the feature

If a collision is detected:
- the agent must select the next available ID

---

### Determinism Requirement

Given the same filesystem state, allocation must always produce the same ID.

No randomness or heuristic ordering is allowed.

---

### Invariant

At all times:

- No two specs within a feature may share the same ID
- IDs are never reused once assigned

---

## Metadata rules

Do not duplicate identity metadata inside the spec file.

In particular, specs should not require:
- `id`
- `parent`
- `status`

These are inferred from filename and path.

## Implementation log rules

Project-wide implementation chronology is recorded in:

`Features/implementation.log`

Agents must append a new entry immediately after completing an active execution spec implementation.

Normal `foundry implement spec <feature>/<id>-<slug>` or `foundry implement spec <feature> <id>` completion appends this entry automatically for active specs.

`foundry spec:validate` enforces that every active spec has an exact matching implementation-log entry.

`foundry spec:log-entry` emits the exact canonical timestamp heading, `- spec:` line, and full entry content expected by implementation-log validation for an active spec.

The implementation log is chronological and append-only.

Each entry must use this required format:

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS ±HHMM
- spec: <feature-name>/<id>-<slug>.md
```

An optional note can be included. The format including the note is:

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS ±HHMM
- spec: <feature-name>/<id>-<slug>.md
- note: <short implementation note>
```

Draft specs must not be logged as implemented unless they were first promoted to an active spec and then actually implemented.

## Design goals

This convention is intended to provide:

- stable immutable spec addresses
- sortable filenames
- arbitrarily deep hierarchy
- URL-safe and aesthetically clean names
- no renaming when new child specs are added
- no need to edit internal file metadata when reorganizing execution state
- clean separation between feature grouping and implementation chronology
